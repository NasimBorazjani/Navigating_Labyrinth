In this problem, the A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path to sort the characters on the board. The initial state and goal state of the board are defined as tuples. The visited_costs dictionary is initialized to store the cost of reaching each visited state. The priority queue is initialized with the initial state as the first element. The heuristic function used is the sum of the Manhattan distances of each tile from its goal position. The algorithm generates all valid actions from the current state, which includes swapping any of the tiles neighboring the empty spot with the empty spot. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until the goal state is reached, and then returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

The game of 'Sort the Chars' is a variant of the 15-puzzle game, where the blank space can only be swapped with its 4 diagonal neighbors. The A* search algorithm is a good fit for this problem as it is complete and optimal, and the heuristic used is both admissible and consistent. The heuristic function used is the sum of the Manhattan distances of each tile from its goal position, which is a lower estimate on the cost to reach the goal state, making it admissible. The heuristic is also consistent as the cost of moving a tile to a neighboring coordinate is always 1, which is exactly the decrease in the Manhattan distance, if the tile is moved toward its goal position, otherwise the estimated cost of the successor node is the same or higher, and the heuristic estimate for the goal state is 0, as the distance of each tile from its goal position would be 0 in the goal state.
