{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In the game 'Sort the Chars', we are given a table of n by m dimensions. This table contains n words, each with m characters, except for the first word which has m - 1 characters and is followed by a blank space. Each character is written on a separate tile. The objective of the game is to rearrange the characters such that row i spells the i-th word in the list, with the blank space being in the top left corner of the goal board, by swapping the blank space with any of its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. Given the list of words and initial state of the board below, where the black space is represented as '_', what is the shortest list of swap actions (reported in python syntax) that can sort the board into the given list of target words? The list must only include the 4 diagonal swap directions: up-right, down-right, up-left, or down-left, representing the direction in ehich the blank space was swpped in. Target words: cam, hill, pray, doer   The initial board: [['i', 'c', 'a', 'm'], ['h', 'p', 'l', 'o'], ['_', 'r', 'a', 'y'], ['d', 'l', 'e', 'r']]", 'is_feasible': [[['i', 'c', 'a', 'm'], ['h', 'p', 'l', 'o'], ['_', 'r', 'a', 'y'], ['d', 'l', 'e', 'r']]], 'is_correct': [[['i', 'c', 'a', 'm'], ['h', 'p', 'l', 'o'], ['_', 'r', 'a', 'y'], ['d', 'l', 'e', 'r']], ['cam', 'hill', 'pray', 'doer']], 'Astar': ["[['i', 'c', 'a', 'm'], ['h', 'p', 'l', 'o'], ['_', 'r', 'a', 'y'], ['d', 'l', 'e', 'r']]", "['cam', 'hill', 'pray', 'doer']"], 'opt': [['up-right', 'down-right', 'down-left', 'up-left', 'up-right', 'down-right', 'up-right', 'up-left', 'down-left', 'down-left', 'down-right', 'up-right', 'up-right', 'up-left', 'down-left', 'up-left'], 16, 0.21660590171813965]}

In this problem, the A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest sequence of actions to sort the board into the given list of target words. The algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by swapping the blank space with any of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The cost of each state is the number of actions taken to reach that state, and the heuristic function is the count of tiles that are not in their goal position. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all tiles are in their goal position, and returns the sequence of actions taken to reach that state.
