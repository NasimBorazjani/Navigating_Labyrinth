{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In the game 'Sort the Chars', we are given a table of n by m dimensions. This table contains n words, each with m characters, except for the first word which has m - 1 characters. Each character is written on a separate tile. The objective of the game is to rearrange the characters such that row i spells the i-th word in the list, with the blank tile, '_', being in the top left corner of the goal board, by swapping the blank space with any of its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. Given the list of words and initial state of the board below, where the black space is represented as '_', what is the shortest list of swap actions (reported in python syntax) that can sort the board into the given list of target words? The list must only include the 4 diagonal swap directions: up-right, down-right, up-left, or down-left, representing the direction in ehich the blank space was swpped in. Target words: katar, bonsai, sambar, mopane, voyeur   The initial board: [['o', 'k', 's', 't', 'a', 'r'], ['b', 'y', 'n', 'i', 'a', 'a'], ['s', 'a', '_', 'b', 'a', 'r'], ['m', 'o', 'p', 'e', 'n', 'u'], ['v', 'o', 'm', 'e', 'a', 'r']]", 'is_feasible': [[['o', 'k', 's', 't', 'a', 'r'], ['b', 'y', 'n', 'i', 'a', 'a'], ['s', 'a', '_', 'b', 'a', 'r'], ['m', 'o', 'p', 'e', 'n', 'u'], ['v', 'o', 'm', 'e', 'a', 'r']]], 'is_correct': [[['o', 'k', 's', 't', 'a', 'r'], ['b', 'y', 'n', 'i', 'a', 'a'], ['s', 'a', '_', 'b', 'a', 'r'], ['m', 'o', 'p', 'e', 'n', 'u'], ['v', 'o', 'm', 'e', 'a', 'r']], ['katar', 'bonsai', 'sambar', 'mopane', 'voyeur']], 'Astar': ["[['o', 'k', 's', 't', 'a', 'r'], ['b', 'y', 'n', 'i', 'a', 'a'], ['s', 'a', '_', 'b', 'a', 'r'], ['m', 'o', 'p', 'e', 'n', 'u'], ['v', 'o', 'm', 'e', 'a', 'r']]", "['katar', 'bonsai', 'sambar', 'mopane', 'voyeur']"], 'opt': [['down-right', 'up-right', 'up-left', 'up-right', 'down-right', 'down-left', 'down-left', 'up-left', 'up-left', 'up-right', 'down-right', 'down-right', 'down-left', 'up-left', 'up-left', 'down-left', 'down-right', 'down-right', 'up-right', 'down-right', 'up-right', 'up-left', 'up-left', 'down-left', 'down-left', 'up-left', 'up-right', 'up-left'], 28, 19.604556798934937]}
