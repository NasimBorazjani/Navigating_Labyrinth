Given the list of words and initial state of the board below, where the black space is represented as '_', what is the shortest list of swap actions (reported in python syntax) that can sort the board into the given list of target words?

In this code, we first initialize the problem variables, including the initial state of the board, the target words, the dimensions of the board, and the possible directions for swapping the blank space. We also initialize the visited_costs dictionary and the priority queue.

In the a_star function, we implement the A* search algorithm. We pop the state with the lowest cost from the queue and check if it is the goal state. If it is, we return the actions taken to reach this state. If it is not, we generate all possible actions from the current state and check if the new state would be valid. If it is, we calculate the cost of the new state and compare it with the cost of the previous state. If the new state is not in the visited_costs dictionary or the cost of the new state is less than the cost of the previous state, we update the visited_costs dictionary and push the new state into the queue.

The heuristic function is not needed in this problem as the goal state is always reachable and the cost of reaching the goal state is 0.

This code solves the problem using the A* search algorithm. The `initialize` function initializes the visited_costs dictionary, the priority queue, and encodes all of the information about the initial state and other variables given in the problem (ie the initial state of the board, the target words, etc). The `a_star` function implements the A* search algorithm, checking if the current state is the goal state, generating all possible actions from the current state, and updating the visited_costs dictionary and the priority queue accordingly. The `heuristic` function estimates the cost to reach the goal state from a given state, in this case, the number of characters in the current state that are not in their correct position in the goal state. The solution is reported as a list of swap actions in Python syntax.

This code first initializes the visited_costs dictionary and the priority queue, and encodes all the information about the initial state and other variables given in the problem (ie the initial state of the board, the target words, the dimensions of the board, etc) in the initialize function. Then, it implements the A* search algorithm in the a_star function, which is a generic implementation of the A* algorithm that does not include any values or attributes of values given in the problem. The heuristic function is then defined to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, and the problem is solved by calling the a_star function and reporting the solution as a list of swap actions in Python syntax.
