The output of the program will be a list of tuples, each representing a move of the blank space in one of the 4 diagonal directions. The tuples are in the order of the moves made. Each tuple contains two elements, the change in the row and column indices of the blank space for the move. For example, (1, 1) represents a move to the down-right direction, (-1, 1) represents a move to the up-right direction, etc.

The output of the program will be a list of tuples, each representing the direction of a swap action. The tuples are in the format (row direction, column direction), where a positive row direction indicates a down swap, a negative row direction indicates an up swap, a positive column direction indicates a right swap, and a negative column direction indicates a left swap.
