This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the board is sorted according to the target words.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions to sort the board.
5. Initialize the board and target words.
6. Call the BFS function to get the list of swap actions.

Here is the Python script:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes represent the possible swap actions. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all the possible states by performing the swap actions. It keeps track of the path from the initial state to each state. When it reaches the goal state (i.e., the state where the board is sorted into the given list of target words), it returns the path from the initial state to the goal state. This path represents the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a Python script that implements this approach:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def is_valid(i, j, n, m):
    return 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m

def get_neighbors(i, j):
    return [(i-1, j+1), (i+1, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i+1, j-1)]

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
    new_board[i1][j1], new_board[i2][j2] = new_board[i2][j2], new_board[i1][j1]
    return new_board

def sort_the_chars(board, target):
    n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
    target_board = [list(word) for word in target]
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        curr_board, path = queue.popleft()
        if curr_board == target_board:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(curr_board)
        for ni, nj in get_neighbors(i, j):
            if is_valid(ni, nj, n, m):
                new_board = swap(curr_board, i, j, ni, nj)
                if str(new_board) not in visited:
                    queue.append((new_board, path + [(i, j, ni, nj)]))
                    visited.add(str(new_board))
    return None

board = [['v', 't', 'u', 'i'], ['o', 'w', 'e', 'i'], ['y', 'd', '_', 'c'], ['d', 'i', 'e', 'm']]
target = ['twi', 'ovey', 'udic', 'diem']
print(sort_the_chars(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then, it generates all the possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. It checks if the new state is valid and if it has not been visited before. If it is valid and not visited, it adds it to the queue and continues the process until it finds the goal state. The path from the initial state to the goal state is stored in the `path` variable and is returned as the result.

The problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a vertex of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made from one state to another. The BFS algorithm will explore all possible states (vertices) and keep track of the shortest path to reach the goal state.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:

            return path
        for (next_state, direction) in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [direction]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    directions = [(1, -1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (-1, 1, 'down-left')]
    blank = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(state) for j, cell in enumerate(row) if cell == '_')
    for di, dj, direction in directions:
        ni, nj = blank[0] + di, blank[1] + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(state) and 0 <= nj < len(state[0]):
            next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
            next_state[blank[0]][blank[1]], next_state[ni][nj] = next_state[ni][nj], next_state[blank[0]][blank[1]]
            yield (next_state, direction)

start = [['_', 'm', 'u', 'p'], ['c', 'e', 'r', 'a'], ['d', 'r', 'e', 'b'], ['v', 'e', 'l', 'o']]
goal = [['m', 'a', 'p', '_'], ['c', 'e', 'r', 'e'], ['d', 'r', 'u', 'b'], ['v', 'e', 'l', 'o']]

print(bfs(start, goal))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes a start state and a goal state. It uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been seen. It then defines a neighbors function that generates all possible next states from a given state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. Finally, it calls the BFS function with the initial and goal states and prints the shortest list of swap actions.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a vertex of the graph. Two states are connected if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, explores all the states that can be reached by a single swap operation, then all the states that can be reached by two swap operations, and so on, until it finds the target state. The path from the initial state to the target state gives the list of swap operations.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()
        if board == target:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(board) and 0 <= nj < len(board[0]):
                swap(board, i, j, ni, nj)
                if str(board) not in visited:
                    queue.append((board[:], path + [direction]))
                    visited.add(str(board))
                swap(board, i, j, ni, nj)
    return None

initial_board = [['a', 's', 't', 'x'], ['t', 'r', 's', 'a'], ['s', 'u', '_', 'p'], ['c', 'a', 'd', 'e']]

print(bfs(initial_board, target_board))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space, then tries to swap it with each of its 4 diagonal neighbors. If the resulting state has not been visited before, it is added to the queue to be explored later. The process continues until the target state is found. The path from the initial state to the target state is stored in the variable `path`, which is updated each time a swap operation is performed.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

The algorithm starts by initializing a queue with the initial state of the board and an empty list of actions. Then, it enters a loop where it dequeues a state and its corresponding actions from the queue, checks if the state is the goal state, and if not, enqueues all the states that can be reached by performing a valid action from the current state, along with the actions that led to those states.

The valid actions are determined by the position of the blank space and the 4 diagonal swap directions: up-right, down-right, up-left, or down-left. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or the queue is empty, which means that there is no solution.

Here is the Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':

    actions = []
    if i > 0 and j < m - 1:

    if i < n - 1 and j > 0:
        actions.append(('down-left', (i + 1, j - 1)))
    return actions

    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the root of the tree (the initial state of the board) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. We will keep track of the path taken to reach each state. When we reach a state that matches the target state, we will return the path taken to reach this state.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set()
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = next((i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if state[i][j] == '_')
    deltas = [(-1, 1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1)]
    for di, dj in deltas:
        if 0 <= i + di < 4 and 0 <= j + dj < 4:
            next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
            next_state[i][j], next_state[i + di][j + dj] = next_state[i + di][j + dj], next_state[i][j]
            yield next_state, (i, j, i + di, j + dj)

start = [['_', 's', 'a', 'n'], ['q', 'u', 'o', 'u'], ['c', 'h', 'u', 't'], ['l', 't', 'r', 'e']]
target = [['s', 'u', 'n', '_'], ['q', 'u', 'o', 't'], ['c', 'h', 'a', 't'], ['l', 'u', 'r', 'e']]
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and target states as input. It then defines a helper function, neighbors, that generates all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the current state and the path taken to reach this state. It then uses a set to keep track of the states that have already been visited. The BFS function continues until it finds a state that matches the target state, at which point it returns the path taken to reach this state.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes represent the possible swaps. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. It keeps track of the path from the initial state to each state. When it reaches the goal state (i.e., the state where the board is sorted into the given list of target words), it returns the path from the initial state to the goal state. This path represents the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path
        for (next_state, direction) in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [direction]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = find_blank(state)
    directions = [(i-1, j+1, 'up-right'), (i+1, j+1, 'down-right'), (i-1, j-1, 'up-left'), (i+1, j-1, 'down-left')]
    result = []
    for x, y, direction in directions:
        if 0 <= x < len(state) and 0 <= y < len(state[0]):
            next_state = swap(state, (i, j), (x, y))
            result.append((next_state, direction))
    return result

def find_blank(state):
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(len(state[0])):
            if state[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(state, pos1, pos2):
    state = [list(row) for row in state]
    state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in state)

start = (('o', 'b', 'e', 'd'), ('c', 'o', 'd', 'u'), ('w', 'a', '_', 'p'), ('y', 'u', 'l', 'p'))
goal = (('b', 'u', 'd', '_'), ('c', 'o', 'd', 'o'), ('w', 'a', 'u', 'p'), ('y', 'e', 'l', 'p'))
print(bfs(start, goal))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state and the goal state as input and returns the shortest list of swap actions. It also defines several helper functions: `neighbors` to find all possible next states and the corresponding swap directions, `find_blank` to find the position of the blank space, and `swap` to swap two tiles. The script then calls the BFS function with the initial state and the goal state and prints the result.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space in the board.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to generate all possible states from the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue and the set. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it removes a state from the queue, generates all possible states from this state, and adds any new states to the queue and the set. If it finds the goal state, it returns the path to this state.
5. Call the BFS function with the initial state and the goal state.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

        for j in range(len(board[i])):

The bfs function performs a breadth-first search from the start state to the target state. It maintains a queue of states to explore and a set of states that have already been explored. For each state, it generates all possible next states by swapping the blank with its 4 diagonal neighbors, and adds these to the queue if they have not been explored before.

The neighbors function generates all possible next states by swapping the blank with its 4 diagonal neighbors. It checks that the new position of the blank is within the bounds of the board.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the root of the tree (in this case, the initial state of the board) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. We will keep track of the path taken to reach each state (i.e., the list of swap actions). When we reach a state that matches the target state (i.e., the board is sorted into the given list of target words), we return the path taken to reach this state.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap(board, pos1, pos2):
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]
    return ["".join(row) for row in board]

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([tuple(start)])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            return path
        blank = find_blank(state)
        for dx, dy, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            nx, ny = blank[0] + dx, blank[1] + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(state) and 0 <= ny < len(state[0]):
                new_state = swap(state, blank, (nx, ny))
                if tuple(new_state) not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_state, path + [direction]))
                    seen.add(tuple(new_state))

start = ['ogh', 'ycdl', 'oa_l', 'awle']
target = ['goa', 'yodh', 'wall', 'acle']
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines helper functions to find the blank space on the board, swap two positions on the board, and perform the BFS algorithm. The bfs function uses a queue to keep track of the current state of the board and the path taken to reach this state. It also uses a set to keep track of the states that have already been visited. For each state, it finds the blank space and tries to swap it with its 4 diagonal neighbors. If a new state is reached that has not been visited before, it is added to the queue and the set of visited states. The function continues until it finds a state that matches the target state, at which point it returns the path taken to reach this state.

The problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the path that leads to each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path that leads to it. This path represents the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])

        if 0 <= i + di < len(state) and 0 <= j + dj < len(state[0]):
            next_state = swap(state, (i, j), (i + di, j + dj))
            yield next_state, action

def find_blank(state):

        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(state, pos1, pos2):
    i1, j1 = pos1
    i2, j2 = pos2
    next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
    next_state[i1][j1], next_state[i2][j2] = next_state[i2][j2], next_state[i1][j1]
    return tuple(map(tuple, next_state))

```

This script defines a function `bfs` that performs the breadth-first search, a function `neighbors` that generates all possible next states and the corresponding actions, a function `find_blank` that finds the position of the blank space, and a function `swap` that swaps two tiles. It then uses these functions to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions. This function will use a queue to store the current state of the board and its corresponding list of swap actions. It will also use a set to store the visited states to avoid duplicate work.
5. Initialize the queue with the initial state of the board and an empty list of swap actions. Also, initialize the set with the initial state.
6. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a state and its corresponding list of swap actions. If this state matches the target words, return the list of swap actions. Otherwise, for each possible swap action, if the resulting state has not been visited, enqueue this state and its corresponding list of swap actions (which is the current list of swap actions plus the new swap action), and add this state to the set.
7. If the queue is empty and no matching state is found, return an empty list to indicate that there is no solution.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap_blank(board, i, j, di, dj):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
    new_board[i][j], new_board[i+di][j+dj] = new_board[i+di][j+dj], new_board[i][j]
    return new_board

def is_goal(board, words):
    return [''.join(row) for row in board] == words

def bfs(board, words):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, actions = queue.popleft()
        if is_goal(board, words):
            return actions
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            if 0 <= i+di < len(board) and 0 <= j+dj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap_blank(board, i, j, di, dj)
                if str(new_board) not in visited:
                    queue.append((new_board, actions + [action]))
                    visited.add(str(new_board))
    return []

words = ['poss', 'smoke', 'casel', 'hiram']
board = [['m', 'p', 'l', 's', 's'], ['s', 'a', 'o', 's', 'e'], ['c', 'a', '_', 'e', 'k'], ['h', 'i', 'r', 'o', 'm']]
print(bfs(board, words))
```

This script will print the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. If there is no solution, it will print an empty list.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached and the swap operation that was performed, so that the sequence of swap operations can be reconstructed once the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    parent = {start: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            path = []
            while state:
                state, action = parent[state]
                if action:
                    path.append(action)
            return path[::-1]

        for action in ['up-right', 'down-right', 'up-left', 'down-left']:
            new_state = swap(state, blank, action)
            if new_state not in visited:
                queue.append(new_state)
                visited.add(new_state)

This script will print the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. Note that the board is represented as a single list of characters, with the blank space represented as '_'. The swap function performs a swap operation by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles, depending on the action. The bfs function performs the breadth-first search, and returns the shortest list of swap actions.

The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a vertex of a graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swap actions. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap actions. It keeps track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. When it reaches the goal state (i.e., the state where the board is sorted into the given list of target words), it returns the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```

This script defines a function `bfs` that performs the BFS algorithm, a function `neighbors` that generates all possible next states and the corresponding swap actions, and a main part that calls the `bfs` function with the initial and goal states. The `bfs` function returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The swap actions are represented as tuples of two integers, where the first integer is the vertical direction and the second integer is the horizontal direction. A positive integer represents a downward or rightward direction, and a negative integer represents an upward or leftward direction.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions. This function will use a queue to store the current state of the board and its corresponding list of swap actions. It will also use a set to store the visited states to avoid duplicate work. For each state, it will generate all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors, and add them to the queue if they have not been visited before. The BFS function will stop when it finds a state that matches the target words, and return its corresponding list of swap actions.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the path taken to reach each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path taken to reach this state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            return path
        for next_state, direction in get_neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [direction]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def get_neighbors(state):
    i, j = find_blank(state)
    neighbors = []
    if i > 0 and j < len(state[0]) - 1:
        neighbors.append(swap(state, i, j, i - 1, j + 1, 'up-right'))
    if i < len(state) - 1 and j < len(state[0]) - 1:
        neighbors.append(swap(state, i, j, i + 1, j + 1, 'down-right'))
    if i > 0 and j > 0:
        neighbors.append(swap(state, i, j, i - 1, j - 1, 'up-left'))
    if i < len(state) - 1 and j > 0:
        neighbors.append(swap(state, i, j, i + 1, j - 1, 'down-left'))
    return neighbors

def find_blank(state):
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(len(state[0])):
            if state[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(state, i, j, new_i, new_j, direction):
    new_state = [list(row) for row in state]
    new_state[i][j], new_state[new_i][new_j] = new_state[new_i][new_j], new_state[i][j]
    return new_state, direction

start = [['t', 'w', 'y', 'l', '_'], ['s', 'a', 'u', 'f', 't'], ['o', 'a', 'e', 'm', 'n'], ['f', 'l', 'd', 'm', 'd']]
target = [['_', 'w', 'o', 'l', 'f'], ['s', 't', 'u', 'n', 't'], ['l', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'y'], ['f', 'a', 'd', 'e', 'd']]
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and target states as input and returns the shortest path from the initial to the target state. It also defines helper functions to get the neighbors of a state, find the blank tile, and swap two tiles. The script then calls the BFS function with the initial and target states and prints the result.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached, and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap actions after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(target, start):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

        for next_state, action in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in visited:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [action]))
                visited.add(next_state)
    return None

        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(state) and 0 <= nj < len(state[0]):
            next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
            next_state[i][j], next_state[ni][nj] = next_state[ni][nj], next_state[i][j]
            yield next_state, action

target = [['b', 'o', 'i', 's', '_'], ['d', 'u', 'r', 'o', 'c'], ['l', 'i', 'n', 'e', 'n'], ['s', 'p', 'e', 'n', 't']]

print(bfs(target, start))
```

This script first defines the `bfs` function, which implements the BFS algorithm. It then defines the `neighbors` function, which generates all possible next states and the corresponding swap actions from a given state. Finally, it calls the `bfs` function with the target and start states, and prints the shortest list of swap actions.

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It also uses a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. The dictionary stores for each state the swap operation that leads to it from its predecessor state, and the predecessor state itself. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

print(bfs(initial, target))
```

This script first initializes the queue with the initial state and an empty path, and the visited dictionary with the initial state and None as its predecessor. Then it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it removes a state and its path from the queue, and checks if it is the target state. If it is, it returns the path. Otherwise, it finds the position of the blank tile in the state, and for each possible swap operation, it creates a new state by swapping the blank tile with its neighbor, and adds the new state and the updated path to the queue, and the new state and its predecessor to the visited dictionary.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a queue and enqueue the initial state of the board.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a board state.
3. If this board state is the goal state, return the list of actions that led to this state.
4. Otherwise, for each possible action (up-right, down-right, up-left, or down-left), apply the action to the board state to get a new board state.
5. If this new board state has not been visited before, enqueue it and add it to the list of visited states.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the queue is empty. If the queue becomes empty, this means that there is no solution.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

        for j in range(len(board[0])):

                return i, j

    return 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m

    n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
    dx = [-1, 1, -1, 1]
    dy = [-1, -1, 1, 1]
    dir = ['up-left', 'down-left', 'up-right', 'down-right']
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(board, [], find_blank(board))])
    while queue:
        curr_board, actions, (x, y) = queue.popleft()

                new_board[x][y], new_board[nx][ny] = new_board[nx][ny], new_board[x][y]
                new_state = (tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_board), actions + [dir[i]], (nx, ny))
                if new_state not in visited:

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the initial board. Then it uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible board states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. It keeps track of the list of actions that led to each board state. When it finds a board state that matches the target words, it returns the list of actions that led to this state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached and the swap operation that was performed, so that the sequence of swap operations can be reconstructed once the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    parent = {start: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()

            while state is not None:
                path.append(parent[state][1])
                state = parent[state][0]
            return path[::-1][1:]
        for next_state, action in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in visited:
                queue.append(next_state)
                visited.add(next_state)
                parent[next_state] = (state, action)
    return None

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = find_blank(state)
    for di, dj, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
        if 0 <= i + di < len(state) and 0 <= j + dj < len(state[0]):
            next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
            next_state[i][j], next_state[i + di][j + dj] = next_state[i + di][j + dj], next_state[i][j]
            yield tuple(map(tuple, next_state)), action

def find_blank(state):
    for i, row in enumerate(state):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '_':
                return i, j

start = (('t', 'd', 'u', 'k', 'e'), ('a', 'a', 'o', 'l', 'l'), ('a', 'm', '_', 'z', 'i'), ('n', 'e', 'u', 'y', 'n'))
target = (('d', 'y', 'k', 'e', '_'), ('a', 't', 'o', 'l', 'l'), ('a', 'm', 'u', 'z', 'e'), ('n', 'i', 'u', 'a', 'n'))
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines the `bfs` function that implements the BFS algorithm, the `neighbors` function that generates all possible next states and the corresponding swap operations, and the `find_blank` function that finds the position of the blank space. It then defines the start and target states, and calls the `bfs` function to find the shortest list of swap actions. The result is printed to the console.

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and goal states as input and returns the shortest path from the initial to the goal state. It also defines a helper function neighbors that takes a state as input and returns all possible states that can be reached from the input state by making a single swap. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue and the set. Then, it enters a loop where it keeps removing states from the queue, exploring their neighbors, and adding the unexplored neighbors to the queue and the set, until it finds the goal state. When it finds the goal state, it returns the path taken to reach this state.

It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached, and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap actions after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[i])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)

def bfs(board, target):
    start = tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)
    target = tuple(tuple(row) for row in target)
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    prev = {start: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()
        if curr == target:
            actions = []
            while curr != start:
                curr, action = prev[curr]
                actions.append(action)
            actions.reverse()
            return actions
        i, j = find_blank(curr)
        for di, dj, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(board) and 0 <= nj < len(board[0]):
                next = swap(curr, i, j, ni, nj)
                if next not in visited:
                    queue.append(next)
                    visited.add(next)
                    prev[next] = (curr, action)
    return None

board = [['u', 's', 'o', 'f', 't'], ['t', 'a', 'n', 'n', 'y'], ['a', 'p', '_', 'm', 'o'], ['f', 'u', 'r', 'a', 'm']]
target = [['_', 's', 'o', 'f', 't'], ['t', 'u', 'n', 'n', 'y'], ['a', 'p', 'a', 'm', 'a'], ['f', 'o', 'r', 'u', 'm']]
print(bfs(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the current state of the board, then it generates all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors, and adds them to the queue if they have not been visited before. It also updates the `prev` dictionary for each new state. When it finds the target state, it uses the `prev` dictionary to reconstruct the shortest list of swap actions.

The problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the root node (the initial state of the board) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles until we reach the goal state (the list of target words). 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path
        for (t, action) in neighbors(state):
            if t not in seen:
                queue.append((t, path + [action]))
                seen.add(t)

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = [(i, row.index('_')) for i, row in enumerate(state) if '_' in row][0]
    swaps = [(i-1, j+1, 'up-right'), (i+1, j+1, 'down-right'), (i-1, j-1, 'up-left'), (i+1, j-1, 'down-left')]
    return [(swap(state, (i, j), (i+di, j+dj)), action) for di, dj, action in swaps if 0 <= i+di < len(state) and 0 <= j+dj < len(state[0])]

def swap(state, p1, p2):
    state = [list(row) for row in state]
    state[p1[0]][p1[1]], state[p2[0]][p2[1]] = state[p2[0]][p2[1]], state[p1[0]][p1[1]]
    return tuple(map(tuple, state))

start = (('a', 's', '_', 'p', 'e'), ('c', 'u', 'd', 'o', 's'), ('l', 'u', 'u', 'a', 's'), ('r', 'c', 'u', 'n', 'e'))
goal = (('s', 'u', 'p', 'e', '_'), ('c', 'a', 'd', 'u', 's'), ('n', 'u', 'c', 'a', 'l'), ('r', 'o', 'u', 's', 'e'))

print(bfs(start, goal))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the start and goal states as input and returns the shortest list of swap actions to reach the goal state from the start state. It also defines a neighbors function that returns all possible states that can be reached from the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. The swap function is used to swap two tiles in the state.

The start and goal states are defined as tuples of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the board. The BFS function is then called with the start and goal states as input, and the result is printed out.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
4. Use a BFS algorithm to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. Keep track of the path of swaps that led to each state.
5. When the target state is found, return the path of swaps that led to it.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state and the goal state as input and returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the goal state. It also defines a helper function neighbors that generates all possible next states and the corresponding actions from a given state. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have been visited. It dequeues a state from the queue, checks if it is the goal state, and if not, enqueues all its unvisited neighbors. The process continues until the queue is empty or the goal state is found.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can move from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states until it finds the goal state. 

The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize a queue with the initial state of the board and an empty list of actions.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a state and its corresponding list of actions.
3. If the dequeued state is the goal state, return the list of actions.
4. Otherwise, for each possible action (up-right, down-right, up-left, down-left), apply the action to the state to get a new state. If the new state has not been visited before, enqueue the new state and the list of actions with the new action appended.
5. If the queue becomes empty and the goal state has not been found, return an indication that the goal state cannot be reached.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def sort_the_chars(target, board):
    target = [list(word) for word in target]
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    actions = ['up-right', 'down-right', 'up-left', 'down-left']

    while queue:

                if str(new_state) not in visited:
                    visited.add(str(new_state))
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), new_state, action_path + [action]))

    return "No solution found"

print(sort_the_chars(target, board))
```

Please note that this problem is NP-hard, which means that the time complexity of the algorithm is exponential in the worst case. Therefore, this script may take a long time to run if the dimensions of the board are large.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to get the current position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to get the possible moves from the current position.
3. Create a function to swap the blank space with a character.
4. Create a function to check if the board is sorted.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path to the sorted board.

Here is the Python script:

```python
from collections import deque

def get_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

    moves = []
    if i > 0 and j < m - 1:
        moves.append((i - 1, j + 1, 'up-right'))
    if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1:
        moves.append((i + 1, j + 1, 'down-right'))
    if i > 0 and j > 0:
        moves.append((i - 1, j - 1, 'up-left'))
    if i < n - 1 and j > 0:
        moves.append((i + 1, j - 1, 'down-left'))
    return moves

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]
    return board

def is_sorted(board, words):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        if ''.join(board[i]) != words[i]:
            return False
    return True

            if str(new_board) not in visited:
                queue.append((new_board, path + [direction]))
                visited.add(str(new_board))
    return []

words = ['jibby', 'entone', 'xenium', 'enwomb']

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the initial board. Then it starts the BFS algorithm from the initial state. For each state, it generates all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. It keeps track of the path followed to reach each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path followed to reach this state. If it cannot reach the target state, it returns an empty list.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can move from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states until it finds the goal state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It also uses a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been explored to avoid exploring the same node more than once. 

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

Incorrect solution type
This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space ('_') in the board.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to generate all possible states from the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue and the set. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it removes a state from the queue, generates all possible states from this state, and adds any new states to the queue and the set. If it finds the goal state, it returns the path to this state.
5. Call the BFS function with the initial state and the goal state.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can go from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors until it finds the goal state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It also uses a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been explored to avoid exploring the same node more than once. 

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()
        if board == target:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(board)

            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(board) and 0 <= nj < len(board[0]):
                swap(board, i, j, ni, nj)
                if str(board) not in visited:
                    queue.append((board[:], path + [direction]))
                    visited.add(str(board))

print(bfs(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then it tries to swap the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. If the new state of the board has not been visited before, it adds it to the queue to be explored later. It also adds the new state to the set of visited states. It continues this process until it finds the goal state or the queue is empty. If it finds the goal state, it returns the list of swap actions that leads to the goal state. If the queue is empty, it means that there is no solution and it returns an empty list.

The problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

The steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space in the board.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to generate all possible states from the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors.
4. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the target state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue. Then, it enters a loop where it removes a state from the queue, generates all possible states from it, and adds them to the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty or the target state is found. The path to the target state is stored in a dictionary where the key is a state and the value is the state from which it was reached.
6. Once the target state is found, use the dictionary to backtrack from the target state to the initial state and generate the list of swap actions.

Here is a python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]

    states = []
    directions = [(i-1, j+1, 'up-right'), (i+1, j+1, 'down-right'), (i-1, j-1, 'up-left'), (i+1, j-1, 'down-left')]
    for di, dj, direction in directions:
        if 0 <= di < len(board) and 0 <= dj < len(board[0]):
            new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
            swap(new_board, i, j, di, dj)
            states.append((new_board, direction))
    return states

def is_goal(board, target_words):
    return [''.join(row) for row in board] == target_words

def solve(board, target_words):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()
        if is_goal(board, target_words):
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for new_board, direction in generate_states(board, i, j):
            new_board_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_board)
            if new_board_tuple not in visited:
                queue.append((new_board, path + [direction]))
                visited.add(new_board_tuple)

initial_board = [['w', 'k', 'u', 'a', 'd', 'i'], ['s', 'a', 'a', 'r', 'm', 'y'], ['h', 'g', '_', 'i', 's', 'h'], ['w', 'h', 'e', 'a', 't', 'y']]
target_words = ['khadi', 'swarmy', 'aguish', 'wheaty']
print(solve(initial_board, target_words))
```

Please note that this script may not return a result for large inputs or inputs where the target state is not reachable from the initial state, as it does not implement any mechanism to limit the search depth or detect unsolvable states.

The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm also keeps track of the path from the initial state to the current state, so that it can return the shortest list of swap actions when it finds the target state. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python

This script first defines the BFS algorithm, which takes the initial state and the target state as input, and returns the shortest list of swap actions. It also defines several helper functions: `get_neighbors` to get all possible states that can be reached from the current state by a single swap operation, `find_blank` to find the position of the blank space, and `swap` to perform a swap operation. Finally, it calls the BFS algorithm with the initial state and the target state, and prints the result.

This script first finds the position of the blank space, then it swaps the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. It checks if the board is sorted according to the target words. If not, it continues the process until the board is sorted. The BFS algorithm ensures that the shortest list of swap actions is found.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can move from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

    return 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m

    directions = ['down-right', 'up-left', 'down-left', 'up-right']
    queue = deque([(board, [], find_blank(board))])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        curr_board, curr_moves, blank_pos = queue.popleft()

            new_i, new_j = blank_pos[0] + move[0], blank_pos[1] + move[1]
            if valid_move(new_i, new_j, len(board), len(board[0])):
                new_board = [row[:] for row in curr_board]
                new_board[blank_pos[0]][blank_pos[1]], new_board[new_i][new_j] = new_board[new_i][new_j], new_board[blank_pos[0]][blank_pos[1]]

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then it uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. It keeps track of the moves made to reach each state and the states that have been visited to avoid cycles. When it finds the target state, it returns the list of moves made to reach it.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the sequence of swaps that led to each state. When it reaches a state that matches the target state, it returns the sequence of swaps that led to that state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and target states of the board as input and returns the shortest sequence of swaps that transforms the initial state into the target state. It also defines helper functions to get the neighbors of a state, find the blank tile, and swap two tiles. Finally, it calls the BFS function with the given initial and target states and prints the result.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to get the current position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to get the possible moves from the current position.
3. Create a function to swap the blank space with a character.
4. Create a function to perform a BFS search. This function will keep track of the visited states and the moves that led to those states. It will stop when it finds the target state and return the moves that led to it.
5. Initialize the BFS search with the initial state of the board and the target state.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def get_blank_pos(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):

    moves = []
    if x > 0 and y < len(board[0]) - 1:

    if x < len(board) - 1 and y < len(board[0]) - 1:

    if x < len(board) - 1 and y > 0:
        moves.append((x + 1, y - 1, 'down-left'))
    return moves

                queue.append((new_state, path + [move[2]]))
                visited.add(new_state)

5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and for each state, it generates all possible states and checks if they match the target words. If a state matches the target words, it returns the list of swap actions that led to this state. If no state matches the target words, it adds the state to a queue and continues with the next state in the queue until it finds a match or the queue is empty.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this problem, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. Each state of the board is represented as a node in the graph, and each valid move (swap) from one state to another is represented as an edge. The BFS algorithm will explore all possible moves from the initial state, then all possible moves from those states, and so on, until it finds the goal state. The path from the initial state to the goal state found by BFS is the shortest path, so it represents the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])

This script defines a function `bfs` that performs the breadth-first search, a function `neighbors` that returns all valid moves from a given state, a function `find_blank` that finds the position of the blank tile in a given state, and a function `swap` that returns a new state after swapping two tiles. The script then defines the initial and goal states and calls the `bfs` function to find the shortest list of swap actions.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the path taken to reach each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path taken to reach this state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

        for j in range(len(state[0])):
            if state[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(state, pos1, pos2):
    state = [list(row) for row in state]
    state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]

```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and target states as input and returns the shortest path from the initial to the target state. It also defines helper functions to find the blank tile, swap two tiles, and generate all possible next states from a given state. The script then calls the BFS function with the initial and target states and prints the resulting path.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space in the board.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to check if the board matches the target words.
4. Create a function to generate all possible next states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue. Then, it enters a loop where it removes a state from the queue, checks if it is the goal state, and if not, adds all its neighbors to the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty or the goal state is found. To avoid exploring the same state multiple times, a set is used to keep track of the explored states.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]

def is_goal(board, target):
    return [''.join(row) for row in board] == target

def neighbors(board, i, j):
    for di, dj in [(-1, 1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1)]:
        if 0 <= i + di < len(board) and 0 <= j + dj < len(board[0]):
            swap(board, i, j, i + di, j + dj)
            yield list(map(list, board)), (di, dj)
            swap(board, i, j, i + di, j + dj)

def solve(board, target):
    start = list(map(list, board))
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = {str(start)}
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()
        if is_goal(board, target):
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for next_board, direction in neighbors(board, i, j):
            if str(next_board) not in seen:
                queue.append((next_board, path + [direction]))
                seen.add(str(next_board))

board = [['a', 'n', 'x', 'e'], ['c', 'y', 'l', 'a'], ['r', 'e', '_', 'n'], ['j', 'h', 'o', 'a'], ['e', 'x', 'b', 'm']]
target = ['nye', 'calx', 'hern', 'jaob', 'exam']
print(solve(board, target))
```

This script will print the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The swap actions are represented as tuples, where (-1, 1) means up-right, (1, 1) means down-right, (-1, -1) means up-left, and (1, -1) means down-left.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap actions after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[i])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    new_board = [list(row) for row in board]
    new_board[i1][j1], new_board[i2][j2] = new_board[i2][j2], new_board[i1][j1]
    return tuple(map(tuple, new_board))

def bfs(initial_board, target_board):
    queue = deque([initial_board])
    visited = set([initial_board])
    prev = {initial_board: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        board = queue.popleft()
        if board == target_board:
            actions = []
            while board != initial_board:
                board, action = prev[board]
                actions.append(action)
            actions.reverse()
            return actions
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            if 0 <= i + di < len(board) and 0 <= j + dj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap(board, i, j, i + di, j + dj)
                if new_board not in visited:
                    queue.append(new_board)
                    visited.add(new_board)
                    prev[new_board] = (board, action)

initial_board = (('u', 't', '_', 'e'), ('k', 'a', 'b', 'm'), ('n', 'e', 'o', 'g'), ('p', 'u', 's', 'o'), ('y', 'o', 'e', 'p'))
target_board = (('t', 'o', 'e', '_'), ('k', 'u', 'b', 'a'), ('m', 'e', 'n', 'g'), ('p', 'e', 's', 'o'), ('y', 'o', 'u', 'p'))
print(bfs(initial_board, target_board))
```

This script first converts the initial and target boards to tuples of tuples, because lists are not hashable and cannot be used as keys in a dictionary or elements in a set in Python. Then it calls the bfs function with the initial and target boards. The bfs function returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the target words.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes represent the possible swap actions. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap actions. It keeps track of the path from the initial state to each explored state. When it reaches the goal state (i.e., the state where the board is sorted into the given list of target words), it returns the path from the initial state to the goal state. This path represents the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a python script that implements this solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path
        for (next_state, action) in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [action]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = state.index('_'), state[0].index('_')
    deltas = [(-1, 1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1)]
    for di, dj in deltas:
        if 0 <= i + di < len(state) and 0 <= j + dj < len(state[0]):
            next_state = [list(row) for row in state]
            next_state[i][j], next_state[i + di][j + dj] = next_state[i + di][j + dj], next_state[i][j]
            yield (next_state, (di, dj))

start = [['i', 'e', 'e', 'd'], ['v', 't', 'n', 'l'], ['o', 'd', '_', 'a'], ['p', 'r', 'c', 'e'], ['p', 'i', 'o', 'l']]
goal = [['_', 'e', 'l', 'd'], ['v', 'i', 'n', 't'], ['e', 'd', 'e', 'a'], ['p', 'o', 'c', 'o'], ['p', 'i', 'r', 'l']]
print(bfs(start, goal))
```

This script defines a function `bfs` that performs the BFS algorithm, a function `neighbors` that generates all possible next states and the corresponding swap actions from a given state, and then uses these functions to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the initial board into the given list of target words. The swap actions are represented as tuples of changes in the row and column indices (di, dj), where di is the change in the row index and dj is the change in the column index. For example, a swap action of (-1, 1) represents a swap in the up-right direction, and a swap action of (1, -1) represents a swap in the down-left direction.

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial and target states as input and returns the shortest sequence of swaps that transforms the initial state into the target state. It also defines helper functions to get the neighbors of a state (i.e., the states that can be reached by making one swap), find the position of the blank tile, and swap two tiles. Finally, it calls the BFS function with the given initial and target states and prints the result.

TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the root of the tree (the initial state of the board) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. We will keep track of the path that leads to each state (the list of swap actions). When we reach a state that matches the goal state (the list of target words), we return the corresponding path.

Here is a Python script that implements this approach:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap(board, pos1, pos2):
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = board[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], board[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]
    return ["".join(row) for row in board]

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    seen = set([tuple(board)])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(state)
        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(board) and 0 <= nj < len(board[0]):
                new_state = swap(state, (i, j), (ni, nj))
                if tuple(new_state) not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_state, path + [direction]))
                    seen.add(tuple(new_state))

board = ['uamr', 'heme', 'miip', 'vavj', 'fimi']
target = ['aer', 'hume', 'mimp', 'viva', 'fiji']
print(bfs(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then, it generates all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. It uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. For each state, it stores the path that leads to it (the list of swap actions). When it finds a state that matches the target state, it returns the corresponding path.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions. This function will use a queue to store the current state of the board and the list of swap actions. It will also use a set to store the visited states to avoid repeating the same state.
5. Initialize the queue with the initial state of the board and an empty list of swap actions. Also, initialize the set with the initial state.
6. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a state and its list of swap actions. If this state matches the target words, return the list of swap actions. Otherwise, for each possible swap action, swap the blank space and enqueue the new state and the new list of swap actions. Also, add the new state to the set.
7. If the queue is empty and no matching state is found, return an empty list to indicate that there is no solution.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap_blank(board, i, j, di, dj):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
    new_board[i][j], new_board[i+di][j+dj] = new_board[i+di][j+dj], new_board[i][j]
    return new_board

def is_goal(board, words):
    return [''.join(row) for row in board] == words

def bfs(board, words):
    moves = [(1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    directions = ['down-left', 'up-right', 'down-right', 'up-left']
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, actions = queue.popleft()
        if is_goal(board, words):
            return actions
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for move, direction in zip(moves, directions):
            di, dj = move

                    visited.add(str(new_board))
    return []

words = ['man', 'cute', 'dazy', 'down', 'oryx']
board = [['u', 'm', 'a', 'n'], ['c', 'd', 't', 'e'], ['o', 'a', '_', 'y'], ['d', 'n', 'w', 'y'], ['o', 'r', 'z', 'x']]
print(bfs(board, words))
```

This script will print the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. If there is no solution, it will print an empty list.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap actions after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[i])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)

def bfs(target, start):
    queue = deque([(start, None, None)])
    seen = set([start])
    parent = {start: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        board, _, _ = queue.popleft()
        if board == target:
            path = []
            while board:
                board, direction = parent[board]
                if direction:
                    path.append(direction)
            return path[::-1]
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            if 0 <= i + di < len(board) and 0 <= j + dj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap(board, i, j, i + di, j + dj)
                if new_board not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_board, board, direction))
                    seen.add(new_board)
                    parent[new_board] = (board, direction)
    return []

target = (('l', 'i', 'z', '_'), ('c', 'o', 'o', 's'), ('e', 'n', 'o', 's'), ('c', 'o', 'z', 'e'), ('g', 'a', 's', 't'))
start = (('o', 'l', '_', 'z'), ('c', 'i', 'o', 's'), ('e', 'n', 'o', 's'), ('c', 'o', 'z', 'e'), ('g', 'a', 's', 't'))
print(bfs(target, start))
```

This script first converts the input lists of strings into tuples of characters, because lists in Python are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys or set elements. It then calls the bfs function with the target and start states. The bfs function returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the target state.

This script defines a function `bfs` that performs the breadth-first search, a function `neighbors` that generates all possible next states from a given state, and then uses these functions to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The `neighbors` function uses the `directions` and `names` lists to generate all possible swaps and their corresponding directions. The `bfs` function uses a queue to keep track of the states to explore and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It dequeues a state from the queue, checks if it matches the goal state, and if not, enqueues all its neighboring states that have not been explored yet.

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then it uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. It keeps track of the path taken to reach each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path taken to reach this state. If it cannot reach the target state, it returns None.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states by performing swap operations until it finds the goal state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It also uses a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been explored to avoid exploring the same node multiple times. 

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path
        for next_state, action in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [action]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    i, j = find_blank(state)
    swaps = [(i-1, j-1, 'up-left'), (i-1, j+1, 'up-right'), (i+1, j-1, 'down-left'), (i+1, j+1, 'down-right')]
    for i2, j2, action in swaps:
        if 0 <= i2 < len(state) and 0 <= j2 < len(state[0]):
            next_state = swap(state, (i, j), (i2, j2))
            yield next_state, action

def find_blank(state):
    for i, row in enumerate(state):
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(state, pos1, pos2):
    state = [list(row) for row in state]
    state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]], state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]] = state[pos2[0]][pos2[1]], state[pos1[0]][pos1[1]]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in state)

start = (('p', 'j', 'm', 'y'), ('e', 'h', 'p', 'o'), ('y', 'o', '_', 'e'), ('r', 'a', 'o', 'n'), ('w', 'a', 'r', 'd'))

print(bfs(start, goal))
```

This script first defines the bfs function that implements the BFS algorithm. It then defines the neighbors function that generates all possible states that can be reached from the current state by a single swap operation. The find_blank function is used to find the position of the blank space in the current state. The swap function is used to perform a swap operation. The script then defines the start and goal states and calls the bfs function to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It also uses a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. The dictionary stores for each state the swap operation that was performed to reach it from its predecessor, and the predecessor state itself. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    visited = {tuple(map(tuple, start)): None}
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

            return path
        blank = [(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if state[i][j] == '_'][0]
        for di, dj, dir in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = blank[0] + di, blank[1] + dj
            if 0 <= ni < 4 and 0 <= nj < 4:
                new_state = [list(row) for row in state]
                new_state[blank[0]][blank[1]], new_state[ni][nj] = new_state[ni][nj], new_state[blank[0]][blank[1]]
                new_state_tuple = tuple(map(tuple, new_state))
                if new_state_tuple not in visited:
                    queue.append((new_state, path + [dir]))
                    visited[new_state_tuple] = (state, dir)
    return []

start = [['e', 'l', 'u', 'w'], ['k', 'k', 'c', 'e'], ['f', 'l', '_', 'a'], ['s', 'r', 's', 'e'], ['h', 'e', 'u', 'b']]
target = [['_', 'l', 'e', 'w'], ['k', 'e', 'c', 'k'], ['f', 'l', 'e', 'a'], ['s', 'u', 's', 'u'], ['h', 'e', 'r', 'b']]
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the current state, and then tries to swap it with each of its 4 diagonal neighbors. If the new state has not been visited before, it is added to the queue to be explored later, and its predecessor state and the swap operation performed to reach it are stored in the dictionary. When the target state is found, the script backtracks from the target state to the initial state using the dictionary, and returns the list of swap operations in the correct order.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Represent the initial state of the board and the target state as 2D lists in Python.
2. Create a function to generate all possible states from the current state by swapping the blank space with any of its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles.
3. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the target state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue. Then, in each iteration, it removes a state from the queue, generates all possible states from it, and adds them to the queue. It continues this process until it finds the target state or the queue is empty.
4. Keep track of the path from the initial state to each state. This can be done by using a dictionary where the key is a state and the value is a tuple containing the previous state and the action that leads to the current state from the previous state.
5. Once the target state is found, use the dictionary to backtrack from the target state to the initial state and collect the actions along the path.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a function to check if the board is sorted according to the target words.
4. Create a BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions.
5. Initialize the board and target words.
6. Call the BFS function to get the shortest list of swap actions.

Here is the Python script:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i, j, di, dj):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
    new_board[i][j], new_board[i+di][j+dj] = new_board[i+di][j+dj], new_board[i][j]
    return new_board

        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            if 0 <= i+di < len(board) and 0 <= j+dj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap(board, i, j, di, dj)
                if str(new_board) not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_board, path + [direction]))

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this problem, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. We will keep track of the sequence of swaps that led to each state. When we reach a state where the board matches the target words, we return the sequence of swaps that led to this state.

```

This script first finds the position of the blank space on the board. Then, it generates all valid moves from this position. For each valid move, it creates a new board state by swapping the blank space with the tile in the direction of the move. If this new board state has not been visited before, it adds it to the queue to be explored later. It also adds the new board state to the set of visited states to avoid revisiting the same state. When it finds a board state that matches the target words, it returns the sequence of swaps that led to this state. If it has explored all possible board states and none of them match the target words, it returns None.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a node of a graph and each valid move (swap) can be considered as an edge connecting two nodes. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible moves. It keeps track of the minimum number of moves required to reach each state from the initial state. The algorithm stops when it reaches the target state (sorted board).

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state of the board and the target state as input. It then initializes a queue with the initial state and an empty path. The visited set is used to keep track of the states that have been visited. The BFS function then enters a loop where it dequeues a state and its path from the queue. If the dequeued state is the target state, it returns the path. Otherwise, it finds the position of the blank tile and tries to move it in all four diagonal directions. If a move leads to a new state that has not been visited before, it enqueues the new state and the path leading to it. The BFS function continues this process until it finds the target state or the queue is empty.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached, and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap operations after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(initial, target):
    queue = deque([initial])
    visited = set([tuple(map(tuple, initial))])
    parent = {tuple(map(tuple, initial)): (None, None)}
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == target:
            path = []
            while current:
                current, action = parent[tuple(map(tuple, current))]
                if action:
                    path.append(action)
            return path[::-1]
        i, j = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(current) for j, cell in enumerate(row) if cell == '_')
        for di, dj, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(current) and 0 <= nj < len(current[0]):
                next_state = [list(row) for row in current]
                next_state[i][j], next_state[ni][nj] = next_state[ni][nj], next_state[i][j]
                if tuple(map(tuple, next_state)) not in visited:
                    queue.append(next_state)
                    visited.add(tuple(map(tuple, next_state)))
                    parent[tuple(map(tuple, next_state))] = (current, action)
    return []

initial = [['_', 's', 's', 'h', 'o'], ['r', 'i', 'l', 'o', 'y'], ['j', 'o', 'l', 'i', 'p'], ['d', 'r', 'a', 'i', 'n'], ['n', 'i', 'v', 'a', 'l']]

The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states that can be reached by a single swap operation. It then explores all states that can be reached from these states, and so on, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm also keeps track of the path from the initial state to each explored state, so when it finds the target state, it can easily find the shortest list of swap actions that leads to the target state. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):

        blank = find_blank(board)
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(blank):
            new_board = swap(board, blank, neighbor)
            if tuple(new_board) not in seen:
                queue.append((new_board, path + [neighbor]))
                seen.add(tuple(new_board))

start = ['hqnag', 'byado', 'decao', 'honur', 'picky']
target = ['quad_', 'bhang', 'decay', 'honor', 'picky']
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines several helper functions: `find_blank` to find the position of the blank tile, `swap` to swap two tiles, `get_neighbors` to get the positions of the four diagonal neighbors of a tile, and `bfs` to perform the breadth-first search. The `bfs` function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue and the set, and then enters a loop where it repeatedly removes a state from the queue, checks if it is the target state, and if not, adds all its neighbors to the queue and the set. When it finds the target state, it returns the path to that state.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this problem, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. Each state of the board is represented as a node in the graph, and each valid move (swap) from one state to another is represented as an edge in the graph. The BFS algorithm will explore all possible moves from the initial state, then all possible moves from those states, and so on, until it finds the goal state.

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state and the goal state as input and returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the goal state. It also defines several helper functions: `neighbors` to find all valid moves from a given state, `find_blank` to find the position of the blank space, and `swap` to swap two tiles. The script then defines the initial state and the goal state and calls the BFS function to find the solution.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to find the initial position of the blank space in the board.
2. Then, we create a queue and add the initial state of the board to the queue.
3. We also create a set to keep track of the visited states.
4. We start a loop and continue until the queue is empty.
5. In each iteration of the loop, we dequeue a state from the queue and check if it is the goal state. If it is, we return the list of actions that led to this state.
6. If the dequeued state is not the goal state, we generate all possible states that can be reached by swapping the blank space with any of its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. We add these states to the queue and continue the loop.
7. If we have explored all possible states and haven't found the goal state, we return an empty list to indicate that it is impossible to sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is the Python script that implements the above steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def is_valid(i, j, n, m):
    return 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m

def bfs(board, target):
    n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
    start = find_blank(board)
    queue = deque([(board, start, [])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        state, blank, actions = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            return actions

        for dx, dy, action in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            x, y = blank[0] + dx, blank[1] + dy
            if is_valid(x, y, n, m):
                new_state = [row[:] for row in state]
                new_state[blank[0]][blank[1]], new_state[x][y] = new_state[x][y], new_state[blank[0]][blank[1]]
                if str(new_state) not in visited:
                    queue.append((new_state, (x, y), actions + [action]))
                    visited.add(str(new_state))

    return []

target = [['s', 'i', 'v', 'a', '_'], ['b', 'r', 'y', 'c', 'e'], ['b', 'i', 'r', 'n', 'y'], ['p', 'u', 'g', 'i', 'l'], ['l', 'i', 'n', 'n', 'e']]
board = [['r', 's', 'c', 'v', 'a'], ['b', 'b', 'y', 'r', 'e'], ['u', 'i', '_', 'n', 'i'], ['p', 'n', 'g', 'i', 'l'], ['l', 'i', 'y', 'n', 'e']]

print(bfs(board, target))
```

Please note that this problem is NP-hard, which means that the time complexity of the solution is exponential in the worst case. Therefore, this script may take a long time to run if the size of the board is large.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts at the root node (the initial state of the board) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. 

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. We will keep track of the path that leads to each state. When we reach a state that matches the target words, we return the path that leads to this state.

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state and the target state as input. It uses a queue to keep track of the current state and the path that leads to this state. It also uses a set to keep track of the states that have been visited. 

The script then defines a function to find all the neighboring states of the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. 

The script also defines a function to find the position of the blank space and a function to swap two tiles.

Finally, the script defines the initial state and the target state and calls the BFS function to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the target words.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a vertex of a graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swap actions. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap actions. It keeps track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. When it reaches the goal state (i.e., the state where the board is sorted into the given list of target words), it returns the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:

This script defines a function `bfs` that implements the BFS algorithm, a function `neighbors` that generates all possible next states and the corresponding swap actions, and then uses these functions to find the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The `neighbors` function uses a list comprehension to find the position of the blank space, and then iterates over the four possible swap directions to generate all possible next states. The `bfs` function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It uses a loop to explore the states in breadth-first order, and when it reaches the goal state, it returns the corresponding path.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space in the board.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to generate all possible states from the current state by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors.
4. Create a function to check if the current state of the board matches the target words.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the target state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It starts by adding the initial state to the queue. Then, it enters a loop where it removes a state from the queue, generates all possible states from it, and adds them to the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty or the target state is found. If the target state is found, the algorithm returns the path from the initial state to the target state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. 

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a vertex of the graph. Two vertices are connected if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations. It keeps track of the sequence of swaps that leads to each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the sequence of swaps that leads to this state. This sequence is the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words, because the BFS algorithm explores all states at a certain depth (i.e., a certain number of swaps from the initial state) before moving on to the next depth.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]
    new_board[i1][j1], new_board[i2][j2] = new_board[i2][j2], new_board[i1][j1]
    return new_board

def neighbors(i, j):
    return [(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)]

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    seen = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()
        if board == target:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for ni, nj in neighbors(i, j):
            if 0 <= ni < len(board) and 0 <= nj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap(board, i, j, ni, nj)
                if str(new_board) not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_board, path + [(i, j, ni, nj)]))
                    seen.add(str(new_board))

initial = [['u', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'e'], ['s', 'l', 'r', 'i', 's'], ['a', 'i', '_', 'e', 'e'], ['b', 'o', 'k', 'b', 'l'], ['s', 'k', 'r', 'f', 'f']]
target = [['_', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'e'], ['s', 'u', 'r', 'e', 's'], ['l', 'i', 'b', 'e', 'r'], ['b', 'i', 'k', 'o', 'l'], ['s', 'k', 'a', 'f', 'f']]
print(bfs(initial, target))
```

This script first defines several helper functions: `find_blank` to find the position of the blank tile, `swap` to swap two tiles, `neighbors` to find the diagonal neighbors of a tile, and `bfs` to perform the breadth-first search. The `bfs` function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. It explores all states reachable from the current state by a single swap operation, and for each new state, it adds it to the queue and the set of seen states, and records the sequence of swaps that leads to this state. When it finds the target state, it returns the sequence of swaps that leads to this state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached and the swap operation that was performed, so that the sequence of swap operations can be reconstructed once the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)

```

This script first defines helper functions to find the blank tile, to swap two tiles, and to perform the BFS algorithm. It then defines the initial and target states of the board, and calls the BFS function to find the shortest sequence of swap operations. The BFS function returns a list of swap operations, or None if the target state cannot be reached.

This script defines two functions: `get_neighbors` and `bfs`. The `get_neighbors` function takes a state of the board and returns all possible states that can be reached by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. The `bfs` function performs the breadth-first search. It takes the initial state and the goal state, and returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the goal state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the path taken to reach each state. When it reaches the target state, it returns the path taken to reach this state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def is_valid(i, j, n, m):
    return 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m

def bfs(board, target):
    n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
    target = [list(word) for word in target]
    queue = deque([(board, [], find_blank(board))])
    visited = set([str(board)])

    while queue:
        curr_board, path, blank = queue.popleft()
        if curr_board == target:
            return path

        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            new_i, new_j = blank[0] + di, blank[1] + dj
            if is_valid(new_i, new_j, n, m):
                new_board = [row[:] for row in curr_board]

print(bfs(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the initial board. It then starts the BFS algorithm by adding the initial state to the queue. For each state, it generates all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors. It checks if the new state has been visited before. If not, it adds the new state to the queue and continues the BFS. When it finds the target state, it returns the path taken to reach this state.

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can go from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors until it finds the goal state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It also uses a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been explored to avoid exploring the same node more than once. 

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import deque

This script first finds the position of the blank space on the board. Then it checks if a move in a certain direction is valid. If the move is valid, it makes the move and adds the new state of the board to the queue. It also keeps track of the path of moves that led to the current state. If the current state is the goal state, it returns the path of moves. If not, it continues with the next state in the queue. The script uses a set to keep track of the visited states to avoid visiting the same state multiple times.

This problem can be solved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, we can represent the board as a graph where each state of the board is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if we can move from one state to the other by swapping the blank space with one of its 4 diagonal neighbors. The BFS algorithm will start from the initial state of the board and explore all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors until it finds the goal state. 

The BFS algorithm guarantees to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state, so the list of swap actions it returns will be the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words.

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([(board, [])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

            new_state, new_path = swap(state, path, direction)
            if new_state not in visited:
                queue.append((new_state, new_path))
                visited.add(new_state)

    return []

def swap(state, path, direction):
    new_state = [list(row) for row in state]
    i, j = find_blank(state)

    if direction == 'up-right' and i > 0 and j < len(state[0]) - 1:
        new_state[i][j], new_state[i - 1][j + 1] = new_state[i - 1][j + 1], new_state[i][j]
    elif direction == 'down-right' and i < len(state) - 1 and j < len(state[0]) - 1:
        new_state[i][j], new_state[i + 1][j + 1] = new_state[i + 1][j + 1], new_state[i][j]
    elif direction == 'up-left' and i > 0 and j > 0:
        new_state[i][j], new_state[i - 1][j - 1] = new_state[i - 1][j - 1], new_state[i][j]
    elif direction == 'down-left' and i < len(state) - 1 and j > 0:
        new_state[i][j], new_state[i + 1][j - 1] = new_state[i + 1][j - 1], new_state[i][j]

    return new_state, path + [direction]

def find_blank(state):
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(len(state[0])):

                return i, j

print(bfs(initial_board, target_board))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state of the board and the target state as input and returns the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the target state. It also defines a swap function that takes a state of the board, a list of swap actions, and a direction as input and returns a new state of the board and a new list of swap actions after swapping the blank space in the given direction. Finally, it defines a find_blank function that finds the position of the blank space in a state of the board.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a function to find the position of the blank space.
2. Create a function to swap two elements in the board.
3. Create a function to generate all possible next states from the current state by moving the blank space in all four diagonal directions.
4. Create a function to check if the current state matches the target state.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the target state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the next states to explore. It also keeps track of the path taken to reach each state to find the shortest path.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It also uses a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. The dictionary stores for each state the swap operation that leads to it from its predecessor state, and the predecessor state itself. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_path(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    visited = {tuple(map(tuple, start)): None}
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            return path
        blank = [(i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(6) if state[i][j] == '_'][0]
        for di, dj, dir in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            ni, nj = blank[0] + di, blank[1] + dj
            if 0 <= ni < 5 and 0 <= nj < 6:
                new_state = [list(row) for row in state]

                if new_state_tuple not in visited:
                    queue.append((new_state, path + [dir]))
                    visited[new_state_tuple] = (state, dir)
    return []

start = [['e', 's', '_', 'r', 'k', 'w'], ['b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'r', 'a'], ['c', 'u', 'e', 'c', 'e', 's'], ['b', 'r', 'n', 'h', 'e', 'a'], ['h', 'o', 'e', 'k', 'r', 'r']]

print(find_path(start, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the current state, then it tries to swap it with each of its 4 diagonal neighbors. If the new state has not been visited before, it is added to the queue to be explored later, and its predecessor state and the swap operation that leads to it are stored in the dictionary. When the target state is found, the script backtracks from the target state to the initial state using the dictionary, and returns the list of swap operations in the correct order.

This script first finds the position of the blank space in the board. Then it starts a BFS from the initial state of the board. For each state, it generates all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors and adds them to the queue if they have not been visited before. It continues this process until it finds the goal state or the queue is empty. If it finds the goal state, it returns the path from the initial state to the goal state. If the queue is empty, it means that there is no solution and it returns an empty list.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a queue and enqueue the initial state of the board.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element.
3. If this element is the goal state, return the path that led to it.
4. Otherwise, for each of the four possible actions (up-right, down-right, up-left, down-left), apply the action to the current state to get a new state.
5. If this new state has not been visited before, enqueue it and add it to the visited states.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the queue is empty.

The Python script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, tile in enumerate(row):
            if tile == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]

def neighbors(i, j):
    return [(i-1, j+1), (i+1, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i+1, j-1)]

def bfs(board, goal):
    start = [row[:] for row in board]
    queue = deque([("", start)])
    visited = set([str(start)])

    while queue:
        path, current = queue.popleft()
        if current == goal:
            return path
        i, j = find_blank(current)
        for di, dj in neighbors(i, j):
            if 0 <= di < len(board) and 0 <= dj < len(board[0]):
                swap(current, i, j, di, dj)
                state = str(current)
                if state not in visited:
                    visited.add(state)
                    queue.append((path + str((di, dj)), [row[:] for row in current]))
                swap(current, i, j, di, dj)

    return "No solution found"

board = [['_', 'd', 'a', 'u', 'n', 'k'], ['a', 'r', 'm', 'r', 'r', 'e'], ['d', 'i', 'u', 'l', 'l', 't'], ['c', 'd', 'u', 'r', 'a', 'c'], ['m', 'i', 'g', 'a', 'o', 'h']]

print(bfs(board, goal))
```

This script will print the shortest list of swap actions that can sort the board into the given list of target words. The swap actions are represented as tuples of coordinates (i, j), where i is the row number and j is the column number.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm also keeps track of the path from the initial state to the current state, so when it finds the target state, it can return the list of swap operations that leads to the target state. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)

def bfs(board, target):

    visited = set([str(board)])
    while queue:
        board, path = queue.popleft()

                    queue.append((board[:], path + [direction]))
                    visited.add(str(board))
                swap(board, i, j, ni, nj)
    return []

This script first finds the position of the blank tile, then it tries to swap it with each of its 4 diagonal neighbors. If the resulting state has not been visited before, it adds it to the queue and continues the search. When it finds the target state, it returns the list of swap operations.

In this case, we will use BFS to explore all possible states of the board by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles until we reach the goal state (the board sorted into the given list of target words).

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state and the target state as input. It then defines a neighbors function that generates all possible states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighboring tiles. The swap function is used to swap two tiles in the state. The start and target states are defined as tuples of tuples, and the BFS function is called with these states as input.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored. It also uses a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from the initial state to each explored state. The dictionary stores for each state the swap operation that leads to it from its predecessor state, and the predecessor state itself. 

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, tile in enumerate(row):
            if tile == '_':
                return i, j

def swap(board, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    board = [list(row) for row in board]
    board[i1][j1], board[i2][j2] = board[i2][j2], board[i1][j1]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)

def bfs(board, target):
    queue = deque([board])
    paths = {board: []}
    while queue:
        board = queue.popleft()
        if board == target:
            return paths[board]
        i, j = find_blank(board)
        for di, dj, direction in [(-1, 1, 'up-right'), (1, 1, 'down-right'), (-1, -1, 'up-left'), (1, -1, 'down-left')]:
            if 0 <= i + di < len(board) and 0 <= j + dj < len(board[0]):
                new_board = swap(board, i, j, i + di, j + dj)
                if new_board not in paths:
                    queue.append(new_board)
                    paths[new_board] = paths[board] + [direction]
    return None

board = (('a', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'n', 'y'), ('l', 'g', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'a'), ('a', 'n', 'n', 'i', '_', 'a'), ('l', 't', 'n', 'd', 's', 'e'), ('a', 'c', 'a', 'i', 'd', 'a'))
target = (('r', 'a', 'f', 't', 'y', '_'), ('l', 'a', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'd'), ('a', 'n', 'g', 'i', 'n', 'a'), ('l', 'a', 'n', 'o', 's', 'e'), ('a', 'c', 'n', 'i', 'd', 'a'))
print(bfs(board, target))
```

This script first finds the position of the blank tile in the current board, then it tries to swap the blank tile with each of its 4 diagonal neighbors, if they exist. If the new board obtained after the swap operation has not been explored before, it is added to the queue to be explored later, and the swap operation and the current board are stored in the dictionary as the predecessor of the new board. The script continues this process until it finds the target board, then it uses the dictionary to construct the shortest list of swap operations from the initial board to the target board.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the board can be considered as a vertex of a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if one can be reached from the other by a single swap operation. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board, and explores all possible states by performing all possible swap operations, until it finds the target state. 

The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of states to be explored, and a set of states that have already been explored. It also maintains a dictionary that maps each state to the state from which it was reached, and the swap operation that was performed to reach it. This dictionary is used to reconstruct the shortest list of swap operations after the target state is found.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    parent = {start: (None, None)}
    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()
        if state == target:
            path = []
            while state != start:
                state, action = parent[state]
                path.append(action)
            path.reverse()
            return path
        blank = state.index('_')
        for action in ['up-right', 'down-right', 'up-left', 'down-left']:
            new_state = swap(state, blank, action)
            if new_state not in visited:
                queue.append(new_state)
                visited.add(new_state)
                parent[new_state] = (state, action)
    return None

def swap(state, blank, action):
    new_state = list(state)
    if action == 'up-right':
        new_state[blank], new_state[blank-1] = new_state[blank-1], new_state[blank]
    elif action == 'down-right':
        new_state[blank], new_state[blank+1] = new_state[blank+1], new_state[blank]
    elif action == 'up-left':
        new_state[blank], new_state[blank-1] = new_state[blank-1], new_state[blank]
    elif action == 'down-left':
        new_state[blank], new_state[blank+1] = new_state[blank+1], new_state[blank]
    return ''.join(new_state)

start = 'ocaaankhmrligthiotugtnrtacz_ythum'
target = 'chankhormictigtagtornalzythum'
print(bfs(start, target))
```

Note: This script assumes that the board is represented as a single string, with the characters in row-major order, and the blank space represented as '_'. The swap function needs to be implemented to correctly handle the swap operations based on the board's dimensions and the blank space's position.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

In this problem, we can consider each state of the board as a node of the graph. The edges of the graph represent the possible swaps that can be made. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the board and explores all possible states by making all possible swaps. It keeps track of the sequence of swaps that led to each state. When it reaches a state that matches the target state, it returns the sequence of swaps that led to this state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_blank(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):

            nx, ny = blank[0] + dx, blank[1] + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(state) and 0 <= ny < len(state[0]):
                new_state = swap(state, blank, (nx, ny))
                if tuple(new_state) not in seen:
                    queue.append((new_state, path + [direction]))
                    seen.add(tuple(new_state))

start = ['oks_tar', 'byniaa', 'sa_bar', 'mopen_u', 'vomear']
target = ['katar_', 'bonsai', 'sambar', 'mopane', 'voyeur']
print(bfs(start, target))
```

This script first defines a helper function `find_blank` to find the position of the blank space in the board. It then defines a helper function `swap` to swap two positions in the board. The main function `bfs` implements the BFS algorithm. It uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been explored. For each state, it finds all possible next states by swapping the blank space with its 4 diagonal neighbors, and adds them to the queue. When it finds a state that matches the target state, it returns the sequence of swaps that led to this state.
