This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and the list of coins chosen so far. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen. The heuristic function is the remaining sum to reach the goal, which is always 0 as we are trying to minimize the total tax paid. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is valid and unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, and returns the list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 250 while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a 4-tuple, where the first element is the sum of the coins chosen so far, the second element is the last coin chosen, the third element is the total tax paid so far, and the fourth element is the number of coins chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The code iterates through all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and adds the new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states if it is unvisited or if a new path with a lower cost to reach the state is found. The code returns the actions taken to reach the goal state, which is a list of the coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen so far. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic function is the remaining sum to reach the goal, as the task is to minimize the total tax paid, not the number of coins chosen. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid, ie the sum of the coins chosen so far and the new coin does not exceed the goal sum and the new coin must be smaller than the previous coin and have an even value or be larger than or equal to the previous coin and have an odd value. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen so far equals the goal sum, and returns the coins chosen so far in that state.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the goal sum of 206, while minimizing the total tax paid. The coins are chosen based on the constraints given in the problem statement. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, which is represented as a graph. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal from each state, which helps guide the search towards the goal.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal state while minimizing the total tax paid. The state is represented as a tuple of four elements: the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and the number of coins chosen so far. The heuristic function is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The actions are represented as a list of coins chosen. The code iterates through all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the coins, and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is valid, it generates the new state and calculates the cost so far. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found, it adds the new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The code continues this process until it finds the goal state or there are no more unvisited states. The code then returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the taxed coin exchange problem. The algorithm starts with an initial state where no coins have been chosen and the total sum and tax are 0. It then generates all possible states by choosing each coin from the list and checks if the new state is valid. A state is valid if the sum of the coins chosen so far and the new coin does not exceed the goal sum, and the new coin is smaller than the previous coin and has an even value or is larger than or equal to the previous coin and has an odd value. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen. The heuristic used is the remaining sum to reach the goal, divided by the maximum possible value of a coin, multiplied by the minimum possible tax value. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum. The solution is the list of coins chosen to reach this state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 246 while minimizing the total tax paid. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins in the current state, which is admissible and consistent. The code iterates through all possible actions from the current state, which includes adding any of the remaining coins to the state. It checks if the new state would be valid, i.e., the coin must not already be in the state, and the sum of the coins in the new state must not exceed the goal state. It also checks if the coin must be smaller than the previous one and have an even value, or be larger than or equal to the previous coin and have an odd value. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found, it adds it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The code returns the actions taken when the sum of the coins in the current state equals the goal state.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid while achieving the goal sum of 296. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, which is represented as a graph where each node is a state of the problem (a list of coins), and each edge is an action (adding a coin to the list). The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal from each state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The cost function is the sum of the tax values of the coins in the state, which is what we are trying to minimize. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state, and only explores new states or revisits old states if it finds a path with a lower cost. The algorithm stops when it finds a state where the sum of the coins equals the goal sum, and returns the actions taken to reach this state, which is the solution to the problem.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid while satisfying the constraints of the problem. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, which is represented as a graph where each node is a state of the problem (a list of coins), and each edge is an action (adding a coin to the list). The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from each state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The priority queue is used to keep track of the states that have not yet been visited, with the state with the lowest estimated total cost (the cost so far plus the heuristic estimate) being visited next. The dictionary is used to keep track of the cost of reaching each visited state, so that if a state is reached again via a different path with a lower cost, the cost and path can be updated. The goal state is reached when the sum of the coins in the current state equals the goal sum.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid while satisfying the constraints of the problem. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented as a tuple containing the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen in order. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm continues to explore the state space until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, at which point it returns the list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal state (337) while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and the sequence of coins chosen. The cost of reaching a state is the total tax paid so far, and the heuristic is the remaining sum to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the coins, and checks if the new state would be valid, ie the sum of the coins chosen so far and the new coin does not exceed the goal state. If the new state is valid, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal state, and returns the sequence of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the current sum, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and the sequence of coins chosen.

The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes adding any of the coins to the current sum, and checks if the action is valid according to the problem constraints. If the new state is unvisited or a lower cost path to the state is found, the state is added to the priority queue.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the goal state with the minimum total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by a tuple containing the total value of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the current state, which is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 351 with the minimum total tax. The heuristic function is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins in the current state, which is admissible and consistent. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes adding any of the remaining coins to the current state. It checks if the new state would be valid, i.e., the coin must not already be in the state, and the sum of the coins in the new state must not exceed the goal state. If the coin is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it adds it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins equals the goal state, and then it returns the actions taken to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The initial state is represented as a tuple of four elements: the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen so far. The goal state is the sum of the coins chosen so far equals 400. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic is 0 as we do not have an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the coins, and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state, and then it returns the coins chosen to reach this state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the current sum of the coins chosen, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic function used is the remaining sum to reach the goal, as we are trying to minimize the tax paid. The priority queue is used to keep track of the states that have not been visited yet, with the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal being visited first. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, at which point it returns the coins chosen. If no such state is found, the function returns None.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal state and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a tuple of the coins chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The code iterates through all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the coins, and checks if the new state would be valid, ie the sum of the coins chosen so far and the new coin does not exceed the goal state. If the new state is valid, it generates the new state and calculates the cost so far, which is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found, it adds the new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The code continues this process until it finds a state that is the goal state, at which point it returns the list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal is 0, as the task is to minimize the total tax paid. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is valid and is unvisited or has a lower cost than the previously visited same state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, and returns the actions taken to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen, and the estimate of the remaining cost is the remaining sum to reach the goal state. The algorithm iteratively chooses the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all possible actions from that state, and adds the resulting new states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state that meets the goal condition, and returns the sequence of actions taken to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 449 and minimizes the total tax paid. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins in the current state, which is admissible and consistent. The code iterates through all possible actions from the current state, which includes adding any of the remaining coins to the current state. It checks if the new state would be valid according to the problem constraints, and if it is, it generates the new state and calculates the cost so far. If the new state is unvisited or a lower cost path to the state is found, it adds the new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins is equal to the goal state, at which point it returns the actions taken to reach this state.
