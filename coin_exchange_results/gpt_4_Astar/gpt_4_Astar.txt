This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 250 and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, and the list of coins chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The code generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is valid and is either unvisited or has a lower cost than the previously visited state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The process continues until the goal state is reached, at which point the list of coins chosen is returned.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and only updates this cost if it finds a cheaper path to this node. The algorithm stops when it finds the goal node, and at this point, the path it has found to the goal node is guaranteed to be the shortest.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states, where each state represents a possible subset of coins that can be chosen. The priority of each state is determined by the sum of the cost to reach that state (the total tax paid so far) and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from that state (the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far). The algorithm repeatedly chooses the state with the lowest priority, generates all possible successors of that state (by choosing any of the remaining coins), and adds them to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, and returns the coins chosen to reach that state. The heuristic function used by the algorithm is admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state) and consistent (the estimated cost from a state to the goal state is non-decreasing along a path), ensuring that the algorithm finds an optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and chooses the node with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal to explore next. The algorithm continues until it reaches the goal node or has explored all possible nodes. In this problem, the states are represented as a graph, where each node is a state of the problem and the edges are the actions that can be taken to move from one state to another. The cost of moving from one state to another is the tax paid for the coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm returns the list of coins chosen to reach the goal sum with the minimum total tax paid.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid. The coins are represented by their values and are listed in the order they are chosen. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, which includes all possible subsets of coins that can be chosen. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far. The goal state is reached when the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum of 233.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the target sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, the coins chosen so far, and the remaining coins. The heuristic function calculates the remaining sum to reach the target sum and estimates the cost to reach the goal state by filling the remaining sum with the smallest coin. The code checks the validity of each new state and updates the queue of states to be visited accordingly. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, and returns the coins chosen in this state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and is non-decreasing along the path to the goal state. The cost of a state is the tax paid for the coin chosen to reach that state. The goal state is reached when the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where each state is a tuple representing the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the list of coins chosen, and the total tax paid. The priority of each state in the queue is the sum of the cost to reach that state (the total tax paid) and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal (the difference between the goal sum and the sum so far). The algorithm repeatedly chooses the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all valid actions from that state (choosing any of the remaining coins), and adds the resulting new states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, and returns the list of coins chosen to reach that state. The heuristic function used by the algorithm is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the algorithm finds the optimal solution.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the current sum of the coins chosen and the last coin chosen. The cost of each state is the total tax paid to reach that state. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the current sum of the coins chosen, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm will return the list of coins chosen when it finds a state where the current sum equals the goal sum.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of 5 elements: the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, the number of coins chosen so far, and a list of the coins chosen so far. The goal state is when the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum. The cost of each state is the total tax paid so far, and the heuristic is the remaining sum to reach the goal. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid according to the rules of the problem. If the new state is valid and either unvisited or reachable with a lower cost, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state, and then returns the list of coins chosen to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. It starts with an initial state where no coins have been chosen and iteratively chooses coins that meet the problem's constraints until the sum of the chosen coins equals the goal sum. The priority queue ensures that states with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal by calculating the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The algorithm returns the coins chosen when it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the target sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the remaining coins. The cost of reaching a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by assuming we can choose the coin with the minimum tax value to reach the remaining sum. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid according to the constraints on the coins. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, which is the goal state, and returns the coins chosen to reach this state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm iteratively chooses a coin from the remaining coins and updates the state and the cost accordingly, until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum. The solution is then returned as a list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the target sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a list of the coins chosen. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid according to the constraints of the problem. If the new state is valid and is either unvisited or has a lower cost than the previously visited state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, and returns the list of coins chosen.

The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the sum of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen so far, the number of coins chosen so far, and a list of the coins chosen so far.

If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state, ie the sum of the coins chosen so far equals the goal sum, and returns the list of coins chosen.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and only updates this cost if it finds a cheaper path to the node. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal node. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the problem, and the edges are the actions that change one state to another. The cost of an action is the tax paid to choose a coin. The heuristic function is an estimate of the remaining tax to pay to reach the goal sum. The algorithm returns the sequence of coins chosen to reach the goal sum with the minimum total tax paid.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of four elements: the total value of the coins chosen so far, the value of the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and a list of the coins chosen in order. The goal state is when the total value of the coins chosen equals 273. The cost of each state is the total tax paid so far. The heuristic used is the remaining sum to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing each of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid according to the problem constraints. If the new state is valid and is either unvisited or has a lower cost than the previously visited same state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state, at which point it returns the list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the target sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the chosen coins and the sum of the chosen coins. The cost of each state is the total tax paid for the chosen coins. The heuristic function is 0 as we don't have any information about the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state, containing the new coin, would be valid; ie the sum of the chosen coins must not exceed the target sum and the coin must satisfy the constraints. If the sum of the chosen coins equals the target sum, the algorithm returns the chosen coins.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the target sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of the chosen coins and their sum. The cost of a state is the total tax paid to reach that state. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state as 0, as the remaining coins could have a tax value of 0. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing each of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state, with the chosen coin, would be valid. If the new state has not been visited before, or if a lower cost path to this state has been found, it is added to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the chosen coins equals the target sum, and returns the chosen coins.

This code will return the list of coins that should be selected to minimize the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the current sum of coins, the last coin chosen, and the set of remaining coins. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the cost so far, the estimated cost to the goal, the last coin chosen, the current sum of the coins chosen, and the actions that led to this state. The cost so far is the sum of the tax values of the coins chosen. The estimated cost to the goal is the same as the cost so far, as we don't have a heuristic to estimate the remaining cost to the goal. The actions that led to this state is a list of the coins chosen. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins. It checks if the new state would be valid according to the constraints of the problem, and if it is, it generates the new state and adds it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state, at which point it returns the actions that led to this state.

This code will return the list of coins that should be selected to minimize the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the remaining coins, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The cost function is the tax paid so far, as the task is to minimize the total tax paid. The goal state is when the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and only updates this cost if it finds a cheaper path to the node. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal node. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the problem, and the edges are the actions that change the state. The cost of an action is the tax of the coin chosen. The heuristic function is the difference between the goal sum and the sum so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic. The algorithm returns the coins chosen when it reaches a state where the sum of the coins equals the goal sum.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the target sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid, and the list of coins chosen. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which is the difference between the target sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The algorithm continues to explore the state space until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, at which point it returns the list of coins chosen.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the sum of the chosen coins so far, the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and the list of chosen coins. The heuristic function used is the absolute difference between the goal sum and the sum of the chosen coins so far. The algorithm generates all possible states by choosing any of the remaining coins and checks if the new state is valid based on the constraints of the problem. If the new state is valid and either unvisited or has a lower cost than the previously visited same state, it is added to the priority queue to be visited. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the chosen coins equals the goal sum, and returns the list of chosen coins.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to 356 and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of four elements: the sum of the coins chosen so far, the index of the last coin chosen, the value of the last coin chosen, the total tax paid so far, and the list of coins chosen so far. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal state and the current state, which is admissible and consistent. The algorithm iterates through all possible states, updating the cost of reaching each state and adding unvisited states to the priority queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state that satisfies the goal condition, and returns the list of coins chosen to reach that state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that is known for its performance and accuracy. It uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal, which ensures that it finds the optimal path to the goal. The heuristic function is problem-specific. In this problem, we use the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far as the heuristic.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes it explores. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each node and the path taken to get there. It continues exploring nodes until it reaches the goal node, at which point it returns the path taken to get there. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the problem, the edges are the actions that can be taken to move from one state to another, and the cost is the total tax paid to reach a state. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining tax to be paid to reach the goal state from a given state.

This problem is a variant of the subset sum problem, which is a classic computer science problem. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, which includes all possible subsets of coins. The algorithm starts with an empty set of coins and iteratively adds coins to the set, checking if the sum of the coins in the set equals the target sum. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first, where the cost of a state is the sum of the tax values of the coins in the set. The algorithm stops when it finds a set of coins that sums up to the target sum. The constraints on the coins are enforced when generating the new states. The heuristic function is 0, as we don't have an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The solution is the set of coins that sums up to the target sum and has the lowest total tax value.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the remaining coins, the sum of the chosen coins, the total tax paid, and the last coin chosen. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the minimum tax values for the remaining coins needed to reach the goal sum, relaxing the even-odd condition. The algorithm iteratively chooses the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated remaining cost until it finds a state where the sum of the chosen coins equals the goal sum. The solution is then returned as a list of the chosen coins.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to a specific sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and the cost of choosing a coin is always greater than or equal to the decrease in the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The algorithm iteratively chooses a coin from the available coins and updates the state until it reaches a state where the sum of the coins chosen is equal to the goal sum. The coins chosen in this state are then returned as the solution.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the remaining coins, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the last coin chosen, and the total tax paid so far. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states, where each state is a tuple containing the current sum of coins, the last coin chosen, and the set of remaining coins. The priority of each state in the queue is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that state. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the taxes of the coins chosen so far, and the estimated cost to reach the goal from a state is the remaining sum to reach the goal sum, divided by the maximum coin value, multiplied by the minimum tax value. The algorithm iteratively chooses the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all possible successor states by choosing any of the remaining coins, and adds the successor states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where the current sum of coins equals the goal sum, and returns the sequence of coins chosen to reach that state.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid while satisfying the constraints of the problem. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by a tuple of the coins chosen so far. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from each state, which helps to prioritize the states to be explored. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, and returns the coins chosen to reach this state.

In this problem, the state is represented as a tuple containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The goal is to find a subset of coins such that the sum of the chosen coins adds up to 397 and the total tax paid is minimized. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and is non-decreasing along the path to the goal state. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum and minimizes the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple of four elements: the current sum of the coins, the last coin added, the total tax paid so far, and the list of coins chosen so far. The heuristic function is not used in this problem because the cost function already provides an exact cost of reaching the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes adding each coin to the current sum. It checks if the coin can be added to the current state based on the constraints of the problem. If the coin can be added, it generates the new state and calculates the cost of the new state. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found, it adds the new state to the priority queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that reaches the goal sum, at which point it returns the list of coins chosen.

This code will return the list of coins chosen to reach the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The coins are chosen according to the rules specified in the problem statement. The A* search algorithm is used to explore the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the remaining coins, the sum of the chosen coins, the tax paid so far, and the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the current sum of the coins, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to a specific sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the sum of the coins chosen so far, the total tax paid so far, the list of coins chosen, the last coin chosen, and the index of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and is non-decreasing along the path. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing any of the remaining coins, and checks if the new state would be valid according to the conditions given in the problem. If the new state is valid and either unvisited or has a lower cost than a previously visited state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum, and returns the list of coins chosen.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and only updates this cost if it finds a shorter path to the node. The algorithm stops when it finds the goal node. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the problem, and the edges are the actions that change one state to another. The cost of an action is the tax of the coin chosen. The heuristic function is the sum of the smallest taxes of the remaining coins that add up to the remaining sum to reach the goal sum. The goal state is when the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that is known for its performance and accuracy. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, which helps it to prioritize which paths to explore. In this problem, the states are represented as tuples containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The goal is to find a subset of coins that adds up to a specific sum, while minimizing the total tax paid. The heuristic used is the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far. The algorithm explores all possible states by choosing any of the remaining coins, and updates the cost of reaching each state as the tax paid for the new coin. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum. The solution is then returned as a list of coins chosen.

This code will return the list of coins that should be chosen to minimize the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents a subset of coins chosen so far. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to prioritize the states to be explored. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where the sum of the coins chosen equals the target sum, and returns the coins chosen in this state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to the goal sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the remaining coins, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the total tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by considering the difference between the goal sum and the sum of the coins chosen so far, and filling the remaining sum with the smallest coin available. The heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state, and it is consistent because the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is non-decreasing along the path to the goal state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the subset of coins that adds up to a specific sum while minimizing the total tax paid. The state of the problem is represented as a tuple containing the coins available, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which is calculated as the remaining sum to reach the goal sum, filled with the smallest unique coin, and paying the tax for that coin. The algorithm continues to choose coins and update the state until the sum of the coins chosen equals the goal sum. The coins chosen are then returned as the solution.

This code will return the list of coins that should be selected to minimize the total tax paid. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is represented by the remaining coins, the sum of the coins chosen so far, the tax paid so far, and the value of the last coin chosen. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.
