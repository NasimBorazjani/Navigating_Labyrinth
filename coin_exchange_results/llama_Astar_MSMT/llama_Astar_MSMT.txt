```

In the above code, we first initialize the problem variables, such as the list of coins, their tax values, the target sum, the initial state, the visited_costs dictionary, and the priority queue. Then, we implement the A* search algorithm in the a_star function. In each iteration of the while loop, we pop the state with the lowest total tax paid from the queue. If the sum of the chosen coins in the current state equals the target sum, we return the actions taken. Otherwise, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes choosing each coin from the list. We check if the coin can be added to the current state, and if it can, we generate the new state, calculate the new cost and heuristic, and push the new state into the queue. If the new state is not in the visited_costs dictionary or its cost is lower than the cost of the previously visited state with the same configuration, we update the visited_costs dictionary and push the new state into the queue. If we have visited all states and have not found a solution, we return None.

The A* algorithm is implemented in the `a_star` function. The function starts by popping the state with the lowest cost from the priority queue. If the sum of the chosen coins in the current state equals the target sum, the function returns the chosen coins. Otherwise, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which is adding the next coin to the chosen coins. The function checks if the new state is valid, ie the sum of the chosen coins does not exceed the target sum. If the new state is valid, the function calculates the cost of the new state and checks if the new state has been visited before and if the cost of the new state is lower than the cost of the previous visit. If these conditions are met, the function updates the cost of the new state, adds the new state to the queue, and pushes it to the priority queue. The function continues until it finds a state with the sum of the chosen coins equal to the target sum. The heuristic function is not explicitly defined in the code, but it is implicitly represented by the difference between the target sum and the sum of the chosen coins in the new state.

   # The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a coin is removed from the state, or equal or less by at most 1 (equal to the cost of reaching the successor node, ie one action) as the maximum amount of tax that can be saved by removing a coin from the state is by using the largest coin that won't cause the sum of the chosen coins to exceed the target sum.
