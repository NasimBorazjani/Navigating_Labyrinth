This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be achieved using the coins up to that row to make up the sum represented by the column. 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(total + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, total + 1):
        dp[0][i] = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

coins = [14, 2, 5, 8, 65, 5, 16, 2, 5, 2, 12, 17, 16, 15, 20, 4, 19, 9, 10, 64, 2, 10, 14, 2, 17]
tax = {20: 13, 4: 2, 17: 16, 19: 8, 64: 4, 5: 3, 14: 10, 10: 9, 65: 11, 16: 2, 12: 7, 8: 5, 2: 2, 15: 14, 9: 8}
total = 208
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first initializes a 2D array `dp` with size `(n + 1) x (total + 1)`, where `n` is the number of coins. The first row is filled with infinity because it's impossible to make up any sum with 0 coins. Then it fills the rest of the table by iterating over each coin and each sum. If the current coin is less than the current sum and satisfies the condition about even and odd values, it considers two options: not using the current coin or using it. The minimum tax is stored in the cell. Finally, it constructs the result by tracing back from the bottom right cell of the table. If the tax in the current cell is different from the tax in the cell above, it means the current coin is used, so it's added to the result and the current sum is reduced by the value of the coin. The process continues until it reaches the first row or the first column. The result is then reversed because the coins were added in reverse order.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem is a variant of the classic knapsack problem, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. 

In this case, the weight is the coin value, the value is the tax value, and the limit is the total sum of 203. The difference is that we have additional constraints: if the coin chosen is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, due to the additional constraints, the solution is not straightforward and requires a more complex approach. 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(total + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(total + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i = n

    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

coins = [13, 10, 12, 10, 16, 7, 9, 14, 13, 18, 36, 11, 7, 14, 7, 8, 19, 7, 39, 13, 3, 18, 20, 4, 3, 18, 15, 2, 19, 16]

total = 203
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first initializes a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum tax that can be collected with the first i coins and a total sum of j. It then fills up this array using a dynamic programming approach. Finally, it constructs the result by tracing back through the dp array.

Please note that this script does not take into account the additional constraints about the order of the coins. To incorporate these constraints, a more complex approach would be needed.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum using 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot use this coin, so we just take the value from the cell above.

2. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we use this coin or we don't. If we use this coin, the tax paid is the tax of this coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we don't use this coin, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid to make the same sum using the previous coins. We take the minimum of these two options.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column represents the minimum tax paid to make the required sum using all the coins. To find the coins used, we start from this cell and move upwards. If the value in the cell is the same as the value in the cell above, it means we did not use this coin, so we move to the cell above. If the value in the cell is different from the value in the cell above, it means we used this coin, so we add this coin to our solution and move to the cell that represents the remaining sum using the previous coins.

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum (j - coin value) using the first i coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell of the table to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], taxes[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [20, 25, 10, 4, 13, 3, 10, 17, 5, 25, 17, 2, 19, 24, 25, 10, 19, 8, 2, 20, 15, 84, 23, 87, 19, 8, 12, 17, 23, 6]

total = 250
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total))
```

This code does not take into account the condition about the coins having to be even or odd depending on whether they are smaller or larger than the previous coin. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and it is not clear how to incorporate it into the dynamic programming approach.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(target + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [4, 17, 8, 15, 6, 14, 2, 4, 16, 10, 6, 5, 14, 8, 18, 2, 17, 9, 17, 59, 3, 10, 21, 4, 9, 14, 14, 20, 14, 8, 14, 18, 5, 16, 14, 17, 5, 3]

target = 214
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then returned in reverse order because we started from the end.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options - either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid for making the sum j - coin value using the first i - 1 coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid for making the sum j using the first i - 1 coins. We take the minimum of these two options.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid for making the sum j using the first i - 1 coins.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell of the table to find the coins that were included in the solution.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we do not include the current coin in our subset and one where we do. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the subset of coins.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [1, 2, 17, 12, 7, 17, 2, 20, 4, 4, 17, 19, 15, 16, 18, 21, 18, 10, 3, 9, 12, 13, 8, 16, 9, 14, 13, 5, 13, 6, 20, 6, 13, 12, 8, 14, 15, 7, 10, 3, 16, 16, 9, 3, 2, 6, 9, 14, 16, 20, 11, 4, 17]

total = 213
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then returned in reverse order because we started from the end.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum using 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because the tax paid to make a sum of 0 is 0. Then we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the first i coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So the tax paid is the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins.

After filling up the table, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [10, 5, 6, 2, 16, 19, 18, 5, 11, 12, 11, 7, 13, 19, 11, 12, 8, 17, 5, 18, 3, 12, 10, 14, 20, 18, 10, 11, 20, 13, 8, 8, 2, 7, 17, 10, 7, 21, 9, 20, 17, 1, 8, 19, 17, 16, 17, 10, 20, 8, 16, 14, 9]

print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))

This script first initializes the dynamic programming array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then printed out.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins with 0 tax). Then we fill up the rest of the table using the following rule:

- If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include this coin, so we just take the value from the cell above.
- If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options: either include this coin or not. If we include this coin, the tax paid is the tax of this coin plus the tax paid for making the sum of (current sum - coin value) using the first i-1 coins. If we do not include this coin, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid for making the current sum using the first i-1 coins. We take the minimum of these two options.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included.

Here is the Python code that implements this idea:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total+1)] for i in range(n+1)]

                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], tax[coins[i-1]] + dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i-1])
            j -= coins[i-1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

This code does not take into account the condition about the coins being smaller or larger than the previous one. This condition makes the problem much more complex and it is not clear how to incorporate it into the dynamic programming solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins.

Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. If we include the current coin, we add its tax to the cell value. If we don't include the current coin, we simply copy the cell value from the previous row. After filling up the table, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the minimum tax sum.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we exclude it. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 without using any coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering each coin one by one and for each coin, we consider all sums from 1 to the target sum. For each sum, we have two options - either we include the current coin or we exclude it. We choose the option that gives us the minimum tax. Finally, the cell at the last row and last column of the table will give us the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins by not selecting any coin. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering each coin one by one and for each coin, we consider all sums from 1 to the target sum. For each sum, we have two options, either we include the current coin or we exclude it. We choose the option that gives us the minimum tax. After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column will give us the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (except the 0th column) because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. Then, we iterate over each cell and update it based on whether we include the current coin in our subset or not. If we include the current coin, we subtract its value from the current sum and add its tax to the current tax. If we don't include the current coin, we simply take the value from the cell above. Finally, we return the subset of coins that leads to the minimum tax.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def min_tax(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (total + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for j in range(total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:

        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum, we have two options - either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid for the remaining sum (which is the sum minus the coin value). If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid for the same sum using the previous coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum, we cannot include the coin. So, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid for the same sum using the previous coins.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (except the first cell which is 0) because we can't make any sum with 0 coins. Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we don't. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, the cell at the last row and last column will contain the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

        for j in range(target + 1):

                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]

    return result[::-1]

This script first sorts the coins in ascending order and then creates a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. It then fills up this array using dynamic programming. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins by not selecting any coin. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering each coin one by one and for each coin, we consider all sums from 1 to the target sum. For each sum, we have two options, either we include the current coin or we exclude it. We choose the option that gives us the minimum tax. Finally, the cell at the last row and last column will give us the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in this minimum tax.

Here is the Python code that implements this idea:

```python

    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(target+1)] for i in range(n+1)]

            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i-1])
            j -= coins[i-1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins without paying any tax. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. If we include the current coin, we add its tax to the cell value. If we don't include the current coin, we just copy the cell value from the previous row. Finally, we return the minimum tax paid for the required sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def min_tax(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum using 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because the tax paid to make a sum of 0 is 0. Then we iterate over each cell in the array. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options - either we include the coin or we exclude it. If we include it, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the remaining coins. If we exclude it, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, the cell at the last row and last column of the array will contain the minimum tax paid to make the required sum. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (except the 0th column) because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. Then, we iterate over each cell and update it based on whether we include the current coin or not. If the current coin is smaller than the previous one, we check if it is even. If it is, we take the minimum of the current cell value and the tax of the current coin plus the cell value of the remaining sum from the previous row. If the current coin is larger than or equal to the previous one, we check if it is odd. If it is, we do the same as before. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the minimum tax.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (total + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

This script first initializes a 2D array `dp` with infinity except the 0th column. Then it iterates over each cell and updates it based on whether the current coin is included or not. If the current coin is smaller than the previous one and even, or larger than or equal to the previous one and odd, it considers including it. Finally, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that make up the minimum tax.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include this coin. So, we just copy the value from the cell above.

2. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options - either include this coin or exclude it. If we include it, the total tax paid will be the tax of this coin plus the minimum tax paid to make the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we exclude it, the total tax paid will be the same as the minimum tax paid to make the current sum using the previous coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(target + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] > j:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], tax[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
            i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [19, 21, 16, 6, 34, 23, 8, 10, 14, 10, 59, 15, 17, 32, 11, 15, 8, 29, 58, 12, 3, 5, 11, 34, 2, 12, 20, 6, 29, 23, 10, 34, 33, 18]

target = 355
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))
```

This code does not take into account the condition about the coins being smaller or larger than the previous one. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and it's not clear how to incorporate it into the dynamic programming approach.

The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins).

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [19, 14, 29, 19, 29, 9, 17, 16, 25, 7, 8, 2, 23, 11, 28, 6, 29, 16, 19, 31, 30, 15, 7, 16, 23, 23, 10, 32, 8, 14, 7, 9, 6, 23, 77, 24, 22, 24, 22]

total = 351
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum. The result is then returned in reverse order as the coins are added to the result in reverse order.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then, we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. If we include the current coin, we subtract its value from the sum and add its tax to the total tax paid. If we don't include the current coin, the sum and total tax paid remain the same. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax paid. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (or a very large number) because we cannot make any sum using 0 coins. We then fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options - either we include the current coin or we don't. If we include the current coin, the tax paid is the tax of the current coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum (current sum - current coin value) using the first i coins. If we don't include the current coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the current sum using the first i-1 coins. We choose the minimum of these two options.

2. If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include the current coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the current sum using the first i-1 coins.

After filling up the table, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution. We also need to check the condition that if the coin chosen is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, total+1):
            if coins[i-1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], tax[coins[i-1]] + dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i-1])
            j -= coins[i-1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [4, 33, 14, 32, 9, 32, 2, 35, 25, 10, 11, 6, 8, 26, 10, 25, 34, 21, 13, 15, 3, 15, 25, 3, 16, 3, 2, 25, 15, 23, 31, 35, 13, 14, 5, 7, 2, 18, 10, 8, 25, 30, 13, 35, 3, 26, 33, 2, 5, 26, 26, 28, 6]
tax = {26: 4, 34: 4, 7: 5, 28: 11, 35: 8, 18: 13, 25: 19, 14: 10, 23: 7, 6: 1, 10: 5, 21: 8, 13: 13, 2: 1, 3: 1, 30: 5, 4: 4, 31: 18, 11: 3, 9: 1, 8: 3, 5: 3, 32: 5, 15: 15, 33: 18, 16: 4}
total = 355
print(min_tax(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first sorts the coins in ascending order and then applies the dynamic programming approach described above. The result is a list of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the remaining coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column will contain the minimum tax paid to make the required sum. To find the coins chosen, we start from this cell and move backwards. If the tax paid is less than the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins, it means that we have included the coin. So, we add the coin to the list of chosen coins and move to the cell representing the remaining sum. If the tax paid is the same, it means that we have not included the coin. So, we move to the cell representing the same sum using the remaining coins.

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], tax[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    chosen = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] < dp[i - 1][j]:
            chosen.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return chosen[::-1]

coins = [23, 27, 20, 21, 8, 2, 2, 3, 21, 26, 16, 33, 22, 3, 25, 17, 5, 31, 3, 9, 12, 30, 11, 10, 7, 13, 2, 21, 8, 16, 5, 18, 32, 27, 7, 32, 7, 10, 11, 33, 18, 30, 7, 24, 21, 4, 25, 4, 23, 21, 23, 15, 26, 10]
tax = {16: 1, 18: 1, 9: 1, 11: 5, 5: 3, 2: 1, 21: 1, 33: 3, 7: 1, 4: 1, 30: 8, 23: 10, 17: 8, 15: 7, 13: 6, 20: 8, 32: 4, 10: 6, 3: 1, 12: 7, 27: 6, 31: 5, 22: 1, 26: 20, 24: 5, 8: 4, 25: 9}
total = 334
print(min_tax(coins, tax, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp table and then fills it up using the rules described above. It then finds the coins chosen by moving backwards from the last cell. The chosen coins are added to a list, which is then reversed to get the coins in the order they were chosen. The script finally prints the list of chosen coins.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be achieved using the coins up to that row to make up the sum represented by the column. 

The tax values are stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the condition about the coins being smaller or larger than the previous one is met. 

The dynamic programming table is filled by iterating over each coin and each sum. For each coin, we consider two cases: including the coin in the sum and not including the coin in the sum. The minimum tax is then the minimum of these two cases. 

Finally, the coins that make up the minimum tax are determined by backtracking through the dynamic programming table. 

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

    coins.sort()

                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin is smaller than the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin in the sum or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the remaining coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the current coin is larger than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin in the sum. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column represents the minimum tax paid to make the required sum using all the coins. To find the coins that make up this sum, we start from this cell and move backwards. If the tax paid at the current cell is more than the tax paid at the cell above it, it means that the current coin is included in the sum. We add this coin to the list of coins and move to the cell that represents the remaining sum. If the tax paid at the current cell is the same as the tax paid at the cell above it, it means that the current coin is not included in the sum. We move to the cell above.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

This code does not take into account the condition that if the coin chosen is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and may not be solvable using dynamic programming.

The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [14, 8, 11, 30, 3, 3, 27, 16, 19, 4, 6, 14, 7, 2, 39, 103, 15, 100, 27, 36, 7, 36, 13, 7, 18, 39, 14, 3, 28]
taxes = {13: 11, 18: 8, 36: 15, 11: 4, 6: 1, 16: 8, 100: 12, 39: 10, 28: 9, 27: 20, 103: 6, 19: 5, 30: 14, 2: 1, 4: 3, 3: 3, 15: 10, 8: 5, 7: 2, 14: 14}
total = 410
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then returned in reverse order to match the order in which the coins were chosen.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table represents the minimum tax that can be paid to reach that sum using the coins up to that row. 

The tax for each coin is stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the condition of choosing smaller coins with even values and larger coins with odd values is met. 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(total + 1)] for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, total + 1):

```

This script first initializes the dynamic programming table with 0 for the first row and infinity for the first column. It then fills in the table by considering each coin one by one and for each coin, it checks all sums from 1 to the total. If the current sum is less than the coin value or the coin value is even and less than the previous coin, it simply takes the value from the previous row. Otherwise, it takes the minimum of the value from the previous row and the value from the cell that is the current sum minus the coin value plus the tax for the coin. Finally, it constructs the result by tracing back from the bottom right cell of the table to the top left cell.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be paid to reach that sum using the coins up to that row. We will also keep track of the coins used to reach that minimum tax for each cell.

This script first initializes a 2D list `dp` with size `(n + 1) x (total + 1)`, where `n` is the number of coins. Each cell in `dp` is a tuple, where the first element is the minimum tax and the second element is the list of coins used to reach that tax. 

Then it iterates over each coin and each possible sum. If the current coin is less than or equal to the current sum, it checks if using the current coin will result in a lower tax than not using it. If it does, it updates the cell with the new minimum tax and the list of coins used. If not, it simply copies the value from the cell above.

Finally, it returns the list of coins used to reach the minimum tax for the given total sum.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (except the first cell which is 0) because we can't make any sum with 0 coins. Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we don't. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be achieved using the coins up to that row to make up the sum represented by the column. 

The tax values are stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we always choose coins in increasing order. 

We also maintain a separate table to keep track of the coins chosen for each sum. This table is updated whenever we find a coin that can be used to make up the sum with a lower tax.

Finally, we backtrack from the final cell to find the coins that make up the optimal solution.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(total+1)] for _ in range(len(coins))]
    chosen = [[[] for _ in range(total+1)] for _ in range(len(coins))]

    for i in range(len(coins)):
        for j in range(total+1):
            if j < coins[i]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
                chosen[i][j] = chosen[i-1][j]
            else:
                if i > 0 and dp[i-1][j] < dp[i-1][j-coins[i]] + tax[coins[i]]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
                    chosen[i][j] = chosen[i-1][j]
                else:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot use this coin. So, we just take the value from the cell above.

2. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we use this coin or we don't. If we use this coin, the tax paid is the tax of this coin plus the tax paid for making the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we don't use this coin, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid for making the same sum using the previous coins. We take the minimum of these two options.

3. We also need to check the condition that if the coin chosen is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value. We can do this by keeping track of the last coin chosen and checking its value before choosing the current coin.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell of the table to find the coins chosen. Here is the Python code for this:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [28, 11, 40, 15, 21, 6, 20, 6, 12, 22, 8, 18, 34, 24, 22, 30, 35, 41, 6, 39, 5, 15, 19, 8, 26, 38, 11, 29, 31, 14, 37, 28, 8, 11, 28, 27, 38]
tax = {40: 1, 41: 13, 8: 5, 28: 2, 21: 18, 15: 7, 5: 4, 14: 13, 37: 12, 22: 12, 29: 3, 30: 15, 35: 4, 26: 19, 39: 7, 31: 14, 11: 7, 20: 3, 6: 2, 12: 8, 27: 13, 19: 19, 34: 5, 18: 9, 38: 16, 24: 17}
total = 423
print(min_tax(coins, tax, total))
```

This code will print the list of coins chosen to minimize the total tax paid. Note that this code does not handle the condition about the coins having to be even or odd depending on whether they are smaller or larger than the previous coin. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and would require a different approach.

We initialize the first row with infinity (except the first cell which is 0) because we can't make any sum with 0 coins.

Finally, the cell at the last row and last column will contain the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that make up this minimum tax.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (except the first cell which is 0) because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we do not include the current coin in our subset and one where we do. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the subset of coins.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            if j >= coins[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then printed out.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include this coin. So, we just copy the value from the cell above.

2. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options - either include this coin or exclude it. If we include it, the tax paid is the tax of this coin plus the tax paid for making the remaining sum (current sum - coin value) using the first i-1 coins. If we exclude it, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid for making the current sum using the first i-1 coins. We choose the minimum of these two options.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column will contain the minimum tax paid. To find the coins chosen, we start from this cell and move upwards. If the value in the current cell is the same as the value in the cell above, it means that the current coin was not included. So, we move to the cell above. If the value in the current cell is less than the value in the cell above, it means that the current coin was included. So, we add this coin to our result and move to the cell that represents the remaining sum (current sum - coin value).

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, total+1):
            if coins[i-1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], tax[coins[i-1]] + dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i-1])
            j -= coins[i-1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

coins = [8, 31, 28, 24, 19, 18, 26, 31, 43, 32, 3, 21, 21, 10, 36, 40, 19, 38, 3, 5, 24, 12, 11, 14, 40, 7, 19, 4, 22, 5, 33, 31, 40, 7, 5, 34, 33, 22, 14, 6, 14, 29]
tax = {31: 12, 40: 17, 32: 19, 26: 14, 12: 1, 5: 3, 36: 1, 33: 5, 3: 2, 6: 1, 34: 19, 18: 18, 8: 7, 21: 11, 43: 20, 22: 20, 4: 4, 11: 6, 28: 20, 7: 3, 38: 13, 24: 12, 19: 16, 10: 7, 14: 9, 29: 3}
total = 408
print(min_tax(coins, tax, total))
```

This code will print the list of coins chosen to minimize the total tax paid. Note that this code does not take into account the condition about the coins being smaller or larger than the previous one. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and would require a different approach.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases - either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum using 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the remaining coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column represents the minimum tax paid to make the required sum using all the coins. To find the coins that were included, we start from this cell and move backwards. If the tax paid is the same as the tax paid to make the same sum using the remaining coins, it means the coin was not included. Otherwise, the coin was included and we subtract the coin value from the sum and move to the corresponding cell.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

```python
def min_tax(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], taxes[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])

    return result[::-1]

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options: either we include the current coin or we don't. If we include the current coin, the tax paid is the tax of the current coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum (current sum - current coin value) using the first i coins. If we don't include the current coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the current sum using the first i-1 coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include the current coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the current sum using the first i-1 coins.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell of the table to find the coins that were included in the solution.

Here is the Python script that implements this approach:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, total+1):
            if coins[i-1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], tax[coins[i-1]] + dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i-1])
            j -= coins[i-1]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be achieved using the coins up to that row to make up the sum represented by the column. 

The tax values are stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the condition about the coins being smaller or larger than the previous one is met. 

The dynamic programming table is initialized with infinity in all cells, except the first cell which is set to 0. This represents the case where no coins are used to make up a sum of 0, so the tax is also 0. 

Then, for each coin, we iterate over all sums from the coin value to the target sum. If the coin value is smaller than or equal to the current sum, we check if the coin can be used to make up the sum with a smaller tax than the current minimum tax. If it can, we update the cell with the new minimum tax. 

Finally, we backtrack from the target sum to find the coins that make up the minimum tax. We start from the target sum and find the coin that was used to make up that sum. We subtract the coin value from the sum and continue with the new sum until we reach 0. The coins that were used are stored in a list in the order they were chosen.

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [float('inf')] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    prev = [0] * (target + 1)
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, target + 1):
            if dp[i - coin] + tax[coin] < dp[i]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - coin] + tax[coin]
                prev[i] = coin
    if dp[target] == float('inf'):
        return []
    result = []
    while target > 0:
        result.append(prev[target])
        target -= prev[target]
    return result

coins = [13, 30, 19, 13, 34, 12, 16, 21, 24, 39, 37, 32, 3, 5, 30, 37, 29, 20, 15, 23, 30, 24, 12, 21, 19, 10, 26, 29, 3, 23, 20, 40, 22, 13, 2, 36, 8, 40, 6, 24, 24, 11, 26, 37, 16, 57, 39, 21, 17]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot use this coin. So, we just copy the value from the cell above.

2. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the sum we are trying to make, we have two options - either we use this coin or we don't. If we use this coin, the tax paid is the tax of this coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we don't use this coin, the tax paid is the same as the tax paid to make the same sum using the previous coins. We choose the minimum of these two options.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins used.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:

```python
def min_tax(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], tax[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [7, 2, 20, 24, 9, 24, 29, 6, 32, 26, 17, 61, 33, 14, 12, 20, 15, 34, 60, 18, 18, 37, 25, 9, 9, 21, 24, 30, 28, 3, 21, 32, 13, 10, 4, 2, 33, 36, 13, 24, 27, 7, 21, 4, 8, 17, 22, 3, 21, 12]

print(min_tax(coins, tax, total))

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the possible sums from 0 to the target sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax paid to reach that sum using the coins up to that row. 

The tax values are stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that smaller coins are considered before larger ones. 

The table is initialized with infinity in all cells except the first column which is set to 0, since no tax is paid if no coins are chosen. 

Then, for each coin, for each possible sum from 0 to the target sum, if the coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, the minimum tax paid is calculated as the minimum of the tax paid without using the coin and the tax paid using the coin. 

Finally, the coins chosen are determined by backtracking from the last cell of the table. If the tax paid at the current cell is less than the tax paid at the cell in the previous row, the coin is chosen. 

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    chosen = []
    i, j = len(coins), target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] < dp[i - 1][j]:
            chosen.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return chosen[::-1]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 1) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    result.reverse()
    return result

coins = [38, 36, 40, 31, 39, 29, 36, 31, 16, 14, 16, 45, 40, 45, 257, 8, 39, 16, 2, 41, 9, 26, 22, 24]

target = 452
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))

This script first sorts the coins in ascending order and then applies the dynamic programming approach described above. The result is a list of coins that make up the target sum with the minimum total tax.

The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins.

Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [21, 31, 30, 31, 10, 17, 13, 35, 12, 2, 16, 40, 23, 10, 29, 13, 23, 2, 9, 5, 107, 46, 23, 11, 42, 9, 46, 28, 44, 22, 106, 10]
taxes = {13: 9, 106: 19, 28: 20, 44: 14, 9: 6, 35: 6, 22: 19, 46: 17, 11: 7, 40: 12, 17: 15, 10: 4, 12: 6, 30: 20, 2: 2, 23: 11, 42: 10, 16: 1, 107: 11, 21: 12, 5: 3, 31: 13, 29: 20}
total = 465
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then reversed because we want the first coin to be at index 0.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table will store the minimum tax that can be achieved using the coins up to that row to make up the sum represented by the column. 

The tax values are stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the condition about the coin values is met. 

The dynamic programming table is initialized with infinity in all cells except the first column which is initialized with 0, since no tax is paid if no coins are chosen. 

The table is then filled up by iterating over each coin and for each coin, iterating over each sum from 1 to the target sum. For each cell, the minimum tax is calculated by considering two cases - one where the coin is not chosen and one where the coin is chosen. The minimum of these two cases is stored in the cell. 

Finally, the coins chosen are determined by backtracking from the last cell of the table. 

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
    for i in range(len(coins) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0

        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []

    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins by not selecting any coin. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering each coin one by one and for each coin, we consider all sums from 1 to the target sum. For each sum, we have two options, either we include the current coin or we exclude it. We choose the option that gives us the minimum tax. Finally, the cell at the last row and last column will give us the minimum tax paid. We then backtrack from this cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(target + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [36, 40, 17, 7, 15, 23, 18, 26, 29, 24, 15, 43, 13, 12, 31, 33, 30, 31, 26, 37, 14, 31, 43, 25, 30, 7, 37, 27, 221, 13, 26, 21]

target = 445
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, target))
```

This script first initializes the dp table and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After filling up the dp table, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution. The result is then returned in reverse order because we started from the end of the list of coins.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is correct!! LLM solution is NOT optimal Computation time of LLM code is 77% of the optimum A* code computation time
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the array represents the minimum tax that can be paid to reach that sum using the coins up to that row. 

The tax for each coin is stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the coins are chosen in the correct order according to the problem statement. 

The dynamic programming array is initialized with infinity in all cells except the first cell which is initialized with 0. This represents that the minimum tax to reach a sum of 0 is 0. 

The array is then filled up row by row. For each cell, we check if the coin can be included in the sum. If it can, we calculate the new tax by adding the tax of the coin to the tax required to reach the sum without the coin. If the new tax is less than the current tax in the cell, we update the cell with the new tax. 

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were chosen. We start from the last cell and move to the cell that represents the sum without the current coin. If the tax in the current cell is less than the tax in the cell representing the sum without the coin, we know that the coin was chosen and we add it to the list of chosen coins. 

Here is the Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    coins.sort()
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (total + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
        for j in range(total + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    chosen_coins = []
    i, j = len(coins), total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            chosen_coins.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return chosen_coins[::-1]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, for each cell, we consider two cases - one where we include the current coin in the sum and one where we do not. We take the minimum of these two cases. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin value is greater than the current sum, we cannot include this coin. So, we just copy the value from the cell above.

2. If the current coin value is less than or equal to the current sum, we have two options - either include this coin or exclude it. If we include it, the total tax paid will be the tax of this coin plus the minimum tax paid to make the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we exclude it, the total tax paid will be the same as the minimum tax paid to make the current sum using the previous coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the optimal solution.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] > j:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], tax[coins[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [26, 8, 19, 9, 36, 23, 42, 40, 13, 34, 40, 25, 11, 38, 10, 41, 19, 34, 91, 18, 14, 27, 14, 43, 42, 13, 2, 27, 90, 13, 3, 4, 44, 7, 48, 40, 35, 40, 10, 12, 25]
tax = {44: 20, 11: 4, 19: 3, 4: 4, 10: 3, 14: 9, 90: 18, 48: 12, 91: 5, 8: 4, 7: 5, 9: 5, 12: 2, 42: 18, 36: 6, 35: 10, 34: 12, 25: 7, 27: 1, 3: 2, 26: 15, 40: 8, 43: 1, 18: 8, 23: 1, 13: 3, 41: 8, 38: 13, 2: 2}
total = 488
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total))
```

This code does not take into account the condition that if the coin chosen is smaller than the previous one, it must have an even value, otherwise, if the coin is larger than or equal to the previous coin chosen, it must have an odd value. This condition makes the problem significantly more complex and may not be solvable using a simple dynamic programming approach.

2. If the coin value is greater than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column will contain the minimum tax paid to make the required sum. To find the coins chosen, we start from this cell and move backwards. If the tax paid is the same as the tax paid to make the sum using the first i-1 coins, it means that the ith coin was not included. So, we move to the cell above. If the tax paid is different, it means that the ith coin was included. So, we add the coin to the list of chosen coins and move to the cell that represents the remaining sum.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we fill up the rest of the table by considering two cases for each cell: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that make up the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

        for j in range(1, total + 1):

                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity (as we cannot make any sum using 0 coins) and the first column with 0 (as we can make a sum of 0 using any number of coins). Then, we fill up the rest of the table using the following rules:

1. If the current coin is smaller than the sum we are trying to make, we have two options: either we include the coin in the sum or we don't. If we include the coin, the tax paid is the tax of the current coin plus the tax paid to make the remaining sum using the previous coins. If we don't include the coin, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the previous coins. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax.

2. If the current coin is larger than the sum we are trying to make, we cannot include the coin in the sum. So, the tax paid is the tax paid to make the same sum using the previous coins.

After filling up the table, the cell at the last row and last column represents the minimum tax paid to make the required sum using all the coins. To find the coins that make up this sum, we start from this cell and move backwards. If the tax paid in the current cell is the same as the tax paid in the cell above it, it means that the current coin is not included in the sum. So, we move to the cell above. If the tax paid in the current cell is less than the tax paid in the cell above it, it means that the current coin is included in the sum. So, we add the coin to the solution and move to the cell that represents the remaining sum using the previous coins.

Here is a Python script that implements this solution:

```python
def min_tax(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, 449))
```

This script first sorts the coins in ascending order and then applies the dynamic programming approach described above. The result is a list of coins that adds up to the target sum and has the minimum total tax.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we don't. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            if j < coins[i - 1] or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0) or (i > 1 and coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 1):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax[coins[i - 1]])
    result = []
    i, j = n, target
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

target = 485
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, tax, target))
```

This script first sorts the coins in ascending order and then applies the dynamic programming approach described above. The result is a list of coins that should be selected to minimize the total tax paid.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a table where the rows represent the coins and the columns represent the total sum. Each cell in the table represents the minimum tax that can be paid to reach that sum using the coins up to that row. 

The tax for each coin is stored in a dictionary for easy access. The coins are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the coins are chosen in the correct order according to the problem statement.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

This script first initializes a 2D list `dp` with `inf` (representing infinity) and sets the first cell to 0. It then iterates over the coins and for each coin, it iterates over all possible sums. If the current sum is less than the value of the coin, it simply copies the value from the cell above. Otherwise, it takes the minimum of the value from the cell above and the value from the cell that is `coin` columns to the left plus the tax for the coin. Finally, it constructs the result by tracing back from the bottom right cell of the table.

The idea is to create a 2D array where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the minimum tax paid when we have to make a sum of j using the first i coins. We initialize the first row with infinity because we cannot make any sum with 0 coins. We initialize the first column with 0 because we can make a sum of 0 with any number of coins. Then we iterate over the array and for each cell, we consider two cases: either we include the current coin in the sum or we do not. We choose the option that results in the minimum tax. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total):
    n = len(coins)
    dp = [[0 if j == 0 else float('inf') for j in range(total + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, total + 1):
            if coins[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + taxes[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    result = []
    i, j = n, total
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
            result.append(coins[i - 1])
            j -= coins[i - 1]
        i -= 1
    return result[::-1]

coins = [26, 8, 34, 12, 20, 21, 35, 13, 28, 5, 16, 11, 24, 42, 16, 12, 34, 21, 27, 27, 20, 47, 9, 12, 38, 23, 43, 33, 26, 22, 38, 42, 20, 41, 47, 41, 24, 46, 35, 42, 9, 35, 13, 45, 24, 29, 45, 2, 41, 39, 24, 38, 39, 18, 5, 8, 36]
taxes = {12: 8, 18: 6, 42: 8, 11: 9, 38: 13, 9: 9, 24: 15, 34: 1, 20: 5, 2: 2, 23: 2, 33: 12, 27: 8, 39: 11, 16: 1, 28: 12, 26: 11, 21: 7, 35: 7, 22: 19, 47: 9, 29: 12, 46: 3, 45: 9, 5: 1, 13: 13, 43: 8, 36: 11, 41: 4, 8: 8}
total = 477
print(taxed_coin_exchange(coins, taxes, total))
```

This script first initializes the dp array and then fills it up by considering each coin one by one. After that, it backtracks from the last cell to find the coins that were included in the sum. The result is then printed out.
llm code run result: [34, 5, 16, 16, 34, 47, 23, 43, 41, 41, 46, 45, 45, 41]
