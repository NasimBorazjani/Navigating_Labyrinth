Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering two cases: including the current coin or excluding it.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Call the function with the given input values and print the result.

Here is a Python script that solves the "taxed coin exchange" problem:

coins = [20, 10, 16, 21, 15, 21, 13, 6, 19, 9, 7, 5, 2, 6, 9, 22, 4, 13, 3, 16, 22, 18, 6, 5, 14, 7, 7, 2, 17, 9, 8, 83, 14]

        i -= 1
    
    return selected_coins

target = 239
selected_coins = minimize_tax(coins, target)
print(selected_coins)
```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
5. Trace back the selected coins that contribute to the minimum tax value.
6. Return the list of selected coins.
7. Set the target sum to 239 and call the `minimize_tax` function to get the solution.
8. Print the selected coins.

coins = [4, 17, 8, 15, 6, 14, 2, 4, 16, 10, 6, 5, 14, 8, 18, 2, 17, 9, 17, 59, 3, 10, 21, 4, 9, 14, 14, 20, 14, 8, 14, 18, 5, 16, 14, 17, 5, 3]

def calculate_tax(coins_subset):
    total_tax = 0
    for coin in coins_subset:
        total_tax += tax_values[coin]
    return total_tax

def find_subset(coins, target_sum, prev_coin=None):
    if target_sum == 0:
        return []
    
    for i in range(len(coins)):
        if coins[i] >= prev_coin and coins[i] % 2 == 0:
            new_target = target_sum - coins[i]
            if new_target >= 0:
                subset = find_subset(coins[i+1:], new_target, coins[i])
                if subset is not None or new_target == 0:
                    return [coins[i]] + subset
    
    return None

target_sum = 214
selected_coins = find_subset(coins, target_sum)
selected_coins_tax = calculate_tax(selected_coins)

print(selected_coins)
print("Total tax paid:", selected_coins_tax)
```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Create a function `calculate_tax` that calculates the total tax paid for a given subset of coins.
3. Create a recursive function `find_subset` that finds the subset of coins that add up to the target sum while following the given rules.
4. Call the `find_subset` function with the list of coins and the target sum of 214.
5. Print the selected coins and the total tax paid for those coins.

4. Create a function `find_min_tax_subset` to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.
5. Iterate through all possible subsets of coins using bitwise operations.
6. Check if the sum of the subset equals the target sum and if the subset meets the conditions for choosing coins based on their values.
7. Calculate the total tax for the current subset and update the minimum tax and subset if the current tax is lower.
8. Print the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating through each coin and target sum combination.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the optimal subset of coins that add up to the target sum with minimum tax paid.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their tax values.
2. Define a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax paid for a given subset of coins.
3. Define a recursive function `find_subset` to find the subset of coins that add up to the target sum while following the given rules.
4. Call the `find_subset` function with the list of coins and the target sum of 213.
5. Print the subset of coins chosen and the total tax paid for that subset.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating through each coin and target sum combination.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the optimal subset of coins that add up to the target sum with minimum tax paid.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

    return dp[target_sum][1]

subset = minimize_tax(coins, 211)
print(subset)
```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and the tax values for each coin.
2. Create a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the total tax paid and the subset of coins chosen for each possible sum from 0 to the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin in the list and update the `dp` table based on the tax values and the previous optimal solution.
5. Return the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid for the target sum.
6. Call the `minimize_tax` function with the given list of coins and the target sum of 211.
7. Print the subset of coins chosen to minimize the total tax paid.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum from 1 to the target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the optimal tax value.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the input values for the coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum from 1 to the target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, tax values, and target sum.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Iterate through the `dp` array to find the selected coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in reverse order to get the coins chosen in order.
6. Define the list of coins, tax values, and target sum.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

4. Define a function `find_subset` that uses dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
5. Print the subset of coins chosen that minimizes the total tax paid.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes a list of coins and a target sum as input.
2. Create a dictionary `tax_values` that stores the tax values for each coin.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` table by considering each coin and each target sum.
5. Trace back the selected coins by starting from the bottom right of the `dp` table and selecting the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
6. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
7. Define the list of coins and the target sum, then call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function to get the result.
8. Print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax for a given subset of coins.
3. Define a recursive function `find_min_tax_subset` to find the subset of coins that add up to the target sum with the minimum total tax paid.
4. The function considers the constraints of choosing coins based on their values and whether they are even or odd compared to the previously chosen coin.
5. Call the `find_min_tax_subset` function with the target sum of 295 to find the optimal subset of coins.
6. Print the resulting subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum from 1 to the target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values given in the problem.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

    return dp[target_sum][1]

target_sum = 295
selected_coins = minimize_tax(coins, target_sum)
print(selected_coins)
```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and the tax values for each coin.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum tax paid and the list of coins chosen for each sum from 0 to the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin in the list and update the `dp` table based on the tax values and the previous optimal solution.
5. Return the list of coins chosen that minimizes the total tax paid for the target sum.
6. Print the list of selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating through each coin and target sum combination.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax paid for each combination of coins and target sum.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering the tax values and constraints of choosing coins.
4. Trace back the selected coins by checking the maximum tax paid and store them in the `selected_coins` list.
5. Return the `selected_coins` list as the result.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their tax values.
2. Define a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax for a given subset of coins.
3. Define a recursive function `find_min_tax_subset` to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
4. The function considers the constraints of choosing coins based on their values and whether they are even or odd compared to the previously chosen coin.
5. The function recursively explores all possible combinations of coins to find the subset with the minimum tax.
6. Finally, the function is called with the target sum of 289, and the result is printed.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum from 1 to the target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, tax values, and target sum.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Create a function `calculate_tax` that calculates the total tax for a given subset of coins.
3. Create a recursive function `find_subset` that finds the subset of coins that add up to the target sum while following the given rules.
4. Call the `find_subset` function with the list of coins and the target sum.
5. Print the selected coins and the total tax paid for those coins.

```

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each combination of coins and target sum.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array based on the conditions given in the problem.
4. Trace back the selected coins based on the maximum tax value calculated and store them in the `selected_coins` list.
5. Return the `selected_coins` list as the result.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Create a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax for a given subset of coins.
3. Create a recursive function `find_min_tax_subset` to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.
4. The function recursively explores all possible combinations of coins that satisfy the given conditions and calculates the total tax for each combination.
5. The function keeps track of the subset of coins with the minimum tax found so far.
6. Finally, call the `find_min_tax_subset` function with the target sum of 355 and print the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Trace back the selected coins by checking the optimal substructure of the problem.
5. Return the selected coins in reverse order to get the correct order of coins chosen.
6. Define the list of coins, tax values, and target sum.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and the dictionary of tax values for each coin.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins, tax values, and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the minimum tax value and the list of selected coins for each possible sum from 0 to the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin in the list and update the `dp` table based on the tax values and the conditions mentioned in the problem.
5. Return the list of selected coins that minimizes the total tax paid for the target sum.
6. Call the `minimize_tax` function with the given inputs and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be achieved for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the optimal tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating through each coin and target sum combination.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array.
5. Return the selected coins in reverse order to get the correct order of coins chosen.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `is_valid_choice` to check if a coin can be chosen based on the rules provided.
3. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that uses dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin and update the dynamic programming table based on the rules and tax values.
5. Return the list of selected coins that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
6. Print the selected coins.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
5. Trace back the selected coins that contribute to the minimum tax value.
6. Return the list of selected coins.
7. Set the target sum to 423 and call the `minimize_tax` function to get the solution.
8. Print the selected coins.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Iterate through the `dp` array to find the selected coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the optimal tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, tax values, and target sum.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a recursive function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins, target sum, previous coin value, whether the previous coin was even or odd, tax values, and a memoization dictionary as input.
3. The function recursively tries to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid while satisfying the given conditions.
4. Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Set the target sum, previous coin value, and whether the previous coin was even or odd.
6. Call the `minimize_tax` function with the initial parameters and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating through each coin and target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Call the function with the given input values and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating over each coin and target sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

```

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be achieved for each subproblem.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
5. Trace back the selected coins that contribute to the minimum tax value.
6. Print the selected coins that minimize the total tax paid for the given target sum.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `minimize_tax` that takes the list of coins and the target sum as input.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the minimum tax paid and the selected coins for each sum from 0 to the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin in the list and update the `dp` table based on the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
5. Return the list of selected coins that minimizes the total tax paid for the target sum.
6. Call the `minimize_tax` function with the given list of coins and target sum, then print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Create a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax paid for a given subset of coins.
3. Create a recursive function `find_subset` to find the subset of coins that add up to the target sum while following the given rules.
4. The function checks each coin in the list to see if it can be added to the subset based on the rules of the problem.
5. If a valid subset is found, it is returned.
6. Finally, the script finds the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid for the target sum and prints the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes a list of coins and a target sum as input.
2. Create a dictionary `tax_values` that maps each coin value to its tax value.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` table by considering each coin and each target sum.
5. Trace back the selected coins by starting from the bottom right of the `dp` table and selecting the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
6. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
7. Define the list of coins and the target sum, then call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes a list of coins and a target sum as input.
2. Create a dictionary `tax_values` that stores the tax values for each coin.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subset of coins and target sum.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` table by considering the constraints of choosing coins based on their values and taxes.
5. Trace back the selected coins by checking the maximum tax value obtained and add them to the `selected_coins` list.
6. Return the `selected_coins` list as the result.
7. Define the list of coins and the target sum, then call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and the tax values for each coin.
2. Define a function `is_valid_choice` to check if a coin can be chosen based on the rules provided.
3. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that uses dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
4. Iterate through each coin and update the dynamic programming table based on the rules and tax values.
5. Return the list of coins chosen that minimizes the total tax paid to reach the target sum.
6. Print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define the list of coins and their corresponding tax values.
2. Define a function `is_valid_choice` to check if a coin can be chosen based on the rules provided.
3. Define a function `calculate_tax` to calculate the total tax for a given subset of coins.
4. Define a recursive function `find_subset` to find the subset of coins that add up to the target sum with minimum tax paid.
5. The `find_subset` function recursively explores all possible combinations of coins, making sure to follow the rules of choosing coins.
6. The function returns the subset of coins that add up to the target sum with the minimum total tax paid.
7. Finally, the script calls the `find_subset` function with the target sum of 471 and prints the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes a list of coins and a target sum as input.
2. Create a dictionary `tax_values` that maps each coin value to its tax value.
3. Initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subset of coins and target sum.
4. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` table by considering the conditions for selecting coins based on their values and taxes.
5. Trace back the selected coins by checking the values in the `dp` table and add them to the `selected_coins` list.
6. Return the `selected_coins` list as the result.
7. Define the list of coins and the target sum.
8. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the given coins and target sum.
9. Print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum from 1 to the target sum.
4. Iterate through the coins and sums, updating the `dp` array based on the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
5. Trace back the selected coins by starting from the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array and moving upwards and towards the left, selecting the coins that contribute to the maximum tax value.
6. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
7. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
8. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by iterating over each coin and target sum combination.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the optimal subset of coins that add up to the target sum with minimum tax paid.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes in the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be achieved for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill up the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Keep track of the selected coins by backtracking through the `dp` array to find the optimal subset of coins that add up to the target sum with minimum tax paid.
5. Return the selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the list of coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define a function `taxed_coin_exchange` that takes the list of coins, target sum, and tax values as input.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum tax value that can be obtained for each subproblem.
3. Use dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array by considering each coin and each possible sum.
4. Iterate through the `dp` array to determine the selected coins that minimize the total tax paid.
5. Return the list of selected coins in the correct order.
6. Define the input values for the coins, target sum, and tax values.
7. Call the `taxed_coin_exchange` function with the input values and print the result.
