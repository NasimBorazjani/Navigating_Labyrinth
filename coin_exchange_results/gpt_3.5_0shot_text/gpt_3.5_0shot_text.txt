To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 208 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {20: 13, 4: 2, 17: 16, 19: 8, 64: 4, 5: 3, 14: 10, 10: 9, 65: 11, 16: 2, 12: 7, 8: 5, 2: 2, 15: 14, 9: 8}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [14, 2, 5, 8, 65, 5, 16, 2, 5, 2, 12, 17, 16, 15, 20, 4, 19, 9, 10, 64, 2, 10, 14, 2, 17]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 208:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 209 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(209):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

6. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 208 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 208
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

7. Reverse the subset list to get the coins in the correct order:
subset.reverse()

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 239 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {22: 18, 21: 1, 14: 12, 10: 8, 8: 6, 17: 9, 6: 4, 7: 6, 9: 3, 20: 13, 19: 12, 5: 3, 13: 8, 4: 3, 83: 14, 3: 2, 18: 1, 2: 1, 16: 2, 15: 3}

2. Create a list of coins:

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 239:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (240) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(240):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 239 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][239]
j = 239
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 229 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
   tax_values = {14: 1, 89: 13, 2: 2, 5: 2, 4: 4, 6: 6, 8: 2, 16: 5, 21: 4, 20: 2, 18: 9, 11: 10, 10: 3, 12: 12, 15: 5, 13: 1, 3: 1, 19: 19, 7: 7, 9: 3}

2. Create a list of coins:
   coins = [3, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15, 18, 5, 21, 19, 12, 15, 5, 9, 4, 16, 8, 4, 7, 7, 7, 2, 16, 14, 18, 3, 89, 21, 12, 10, 7, 14, 4, 11, 6, 20]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 229:
   dp = [[float('inf')] * 230 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
   dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
   for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
       for j in range(230):
           dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 229 with the minimum total tax paid:
   subset = []
   total_tax = dp[len(coins)][229]
   current_sum = 229
   for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
       if dp[i][current_sum] != dp[i-1][current_sum]:
           subset.append(coins[i-1])
           current_sum -= coins[i-1]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 236 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {21: 11, 18: 16, 16: 6, 12: 5, 14: 11, 11: 8, 15: 11, 4: 3, 9: 2, 23: 14, 7: 5, 20: 12, 6: 2, 8: 3, 17: 6, 13: 3, 3: 3, 2: 1, 10: 5}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [6, 20, 15, 14, 23, 6, 8, 15, 11, 2, 16, 21, 17, 10, 23, 20, 21, 16, 13, 3, 7, 4, 9, 21, 7, 13, 10, 18, 11, 9, 13, 12, 15, 17, 2, 8, 18, 3, 16, 9, 3, 14, 23, 16]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 236:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (236 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Initialize a 2D list to store the previous coin index used to achieve the minimum tax:
prev_coin = [[-1] * (236 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]

6. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(236 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]] < dp[i - 1][j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]]
            prev_coin[i][j] = j - coins[i - 1]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

7. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 236 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 236
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if prev_coin[i][total] != -1:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total = prev_coin[i][total]

8. Reverse the subset list to get the correct order of coins chosen:
subset.reverse()

To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total tax for each possible subset of coins that adds up to 228. We will then choose the subset with the minimum total tax.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
   tax_values = {6: 1, 7: 3, 9: 1, 18: 1, 2: 1, 11: 7, 5: 3, 12: 2, 3: 3, 22: 6, 14: 3, 20: 15, 4: 3, 17: 4, 16: 8, 23: 18, 21: 16, 19: 2, 8: 6}

2. Create a function to calculate the total tax for a subset of coins:
   def calculate_total_tax(subset):
       total_tax = 0
       for coin in subset:
           total_tax += tax_values[coin]
       return total_tax

3. Generate all possible subsets of coins that add up to 228:
   import itertools
   coins = [21, 20, 21, 11, 23, 16, 16, 16, 3, 20, 2, 19, 16, 21, 18, 7, 20, 3, 16, 18, 7, 22, 3, 22, 7, 21, 12, 22, 5, 6, 17, 16, 8, 8, 14, 4, 18, 9, 4, 20, 2]
   target_sum = 228
   possible_subsets = [subset for subset in itertools.combinations(coins, 4) if sum(subset) == target_sum]

4. Find the subset with the minimum total tax:
   min_tax = float('inf')
   best_subset = None
   for subset in possible_subsets:
       total_tax = calculate_total_tax(subset)
       if total_tax < min_tax:
           min_tax = total_tax
           best_subset = subset

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 230 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [9, 2, 23, 20, 13, 4, 15, 16, 12, 21, 13, 9, 2, 14, 13, 14, 4, 19, 12, 6, 21, 23, 4, 18, 2, 23, 23, 6, 18, 23, 3, 16, 7, 2, 22, 16, 8, 10, 23, 17, 3, 18, 8]
tax_values = {9: 1, 17: 6, 2: 2, 22: 9, 13: 13, 16: 8, 12: 4, 4: 1, 21: 14, 14: 10, 19: 9, 10: 7, 7: 6, 8: 7, 6: 2, 23: 16, 18: 3, 20: 2, 3: 1, 15: 2}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 230:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 231 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(231):
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]]) if j >= coins[i-1] else dp[i-1][j]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 230 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][230]
j = 230
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i-1])
        j -= coins[i-1]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 216 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {6: 6, 8: 6, 16: 4, 15: 11, 12: 3, 10: 5, 20: 14, 9: 3, 17: 8, 7: 5, 5: 5, 2: 1, 11: 4, 23: 18, 19: 3, 13: 13, 18: 6, 4: 3, 21: 20}

5. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 206 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Define the list of coins and their tax values:

3. Iterate over each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 206 with the minimum total tax paid:

while i > 0 and j > 0:
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 213 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [1, 2, 17, 12, 7, 17, 2, 20, 4, 4, 17, 19, 15, 16, 18, 21, 18, 10, 3, 9, 12, 13, 8, 16, 9, 14, 13, 5, 13, 6, 20, 6, 13, 12, 8, 14, 15, 7, 10, 3, 16, 16, 9, 3, 2, 6, 9, 14, 16, 20, 11, 4, 17]

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 213:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 214 for _ in range(len(coins))]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(len(coins)):
    for j in range(214):
        if j >= coins[i]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i]] + tax_values[coins[i]])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 213 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[-1][-1]
j = 213
for i in range(len(coins)-1, 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i])
        j -= coins[i]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 211 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {7: 2, 3: 2, 18: 1, 13: 3, 2: 2, 19: 17, 16: 6, 10: 1, 9: 9, 12: 7, 8: 7, 6: 3, 21: 18, 11: 10, 14: 13, 1: 1, 5: 5, 20: 18, 17: 14}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [10, 5, 6, 2, 16, 19, 18, 5, 11, 12, 11, 7, 13, 19, 11, 12, 8, 17, 5, 18, 3, 12, 10, 14, 20, 18, 10, 11, 20, 13, 8, 8, 2, 7, 17, 10, 7, 21, 9, 20, 17, 1, 8, 19, 17, 16, 17, 10, 20, 8, 16, 14, 9]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 211:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (211 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(211 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

6. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 211 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 211
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

7. Print the final answer in Python list format:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 210 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Define the list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [17, 19, 5, 17, 13, 2, 12, 4, 4, 15, 19, 7, 18, 15, 4, 6, 9, 2, 4, 11, 21, 17, 20, 4, 8, 2, 19, 16, 2, 12, 8, 16, 18, 3, 18, 13, 3, 15, 7, 18, 4, 14, 3, 5, 8, 7, 19, 9, 17, 5, 17, 6, 3, 5, 15]

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 210:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (210 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(210 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 210 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 210
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total tax for each possible subset of coins that adds up to 284. We will then choose the subset with the minimum total tax.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [28, 5, 25, 22, 26, 13, 20, 20, 18, 28, 7, 20, 18, 19, 18, 5, 15, 23, 28, 27, 22, 10, 8, 17, 3, 8, 5, 11, 21, 17, 65, 23, 11, 3, 12]
tax_values = {20: 12, 21: 3, 5: 2, 3: 2, 7: 1, 15: 8, 8: 7, 27: 6, 17: 8, 18: 14, 28: 5, 13: 1, 23: 4, 65: 8, 26: 8, 22: 5, 25: 3, 11: 11, 12: 8, 19: 19, 10: 7}

2. Generate all possible subsets of coins that add up to 284:
We will use the itertools library in Python to generate all possible subsets.

```python
import itertools

target_sum = 284
possible_subsets = []
for r in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(coins, r):
        if sum(subset) == target_sum:
            possible_subsets.append(subset)
```

3. Calculate the total tax for each subset:
```python
def calculate_total_tax(subset):
    total_tax = 0
    previous_coin = None
    for coin in subset:
        if previous_coin is None or coin >= previous_coin:
            if coin % 2 == 0:
                total_tax += tax_values[coin]
        else:
            if coin % 2 != 0:
                total_tax += tax_values[coin]
        previous_coin = coin
    return total_tax

total_taxes = [calculate_total_tax(subset) for subset in possible_subsets]
```

4. Find the subset with the minimum total tax:
```python
min_tax_index = total_taxes.index(min(total_taxes))
min_tax_subset = possible_subsets[min_tax_index]
```

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 307 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
   tax_values = {24: 14, 2: 1, 25: 2, 26: 14, 18: 12, 27: 15, 29: 19, 19: 3, 15: 7, 9: 1, 8: 1, 21: 18, 6: 1, 71: 3, 23: 4, 17: 7, 7: 2, 22: 11, 3: 1}

2. Create a list of coins:
   coins = [29, 29, 22, 23, 23, 3, 26, 9, 15, 8, 21, 15, 29, 25, 71, 27, 23, 6, 7, 9, 15, 21, 6, 8, 19, 17, 18, 6, 26, 24, 24, 3, 25, 2]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 307:
   dp = [[float('inf')] * (308) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
   dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
   for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
       for j in range(308):
           dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j])
           if j >= coins[i-1]:
               dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 307 with the minimum total tax paid:
   subset = []
   total = 307
   for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
       if dp[i][total] != dp[i-1][total]:
           subset.append(coins[i-1])
           total -= coins[i-1]

To solve this problem, we will first create a list of tuples containing the coin values and their corresponding tax values. Then, we will iterate through all possible subsets of coins to find the subset that adds up to 301 with the given conditions.

2. Initialize variables to keep track of the best subset and its total tax:
best_subset = []
best_tax = float('inf')

tax_values = {24: 14, 27: 10, 22: 14, 16: 7, 14: 12, 6: 3, 8: 7, 23: 6, 18: 18, 5: 3, 25: 8, 7: 6, 12: 3, 15: 8, 9: 2, 19: 15, 2: 1, 4: 1, 26: 15, 10: 8, 21: 19}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [26, 19, 7, 24, 27, 15, 9, 9, 9, 26, 15, 23, 6, 6, 24, 8, 21, 6, 6, 7, 25, 22, 8, 2, 7, 5, 8, 18, 14, 15, 24, 10, 4, 23, 21, 8, 18, 12, 16]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 267:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (267 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(267 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]] < dp[i][j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]]

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 267 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 267
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 264 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {26: 12, 25: 20, 17: 13, 13: 4, 16: 13, 11: 10, 24: 5, 5: 4, 8: 6, 7: 5, 4: 4, 12: 9, 18: 12, 3: 2, 21: 17, 19: 7, 2: 2, 9: 9, 6: 2, 15: 4}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [19, 2, 25, 9, 6, 24, 4, 26, 17, 11, 11, 2, 17, 2, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3, 18, 26, 18, 21, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 8, 18, 24, 5, 19, 7, 18, 25, 12, 13, 12, 2, 25, 16, 17, 16, 3, 3]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 264:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (265) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(265):
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] != float('inf'):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

6. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 264 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][264]
current_sum = 264
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][current_sum] != dp[i - 1][current_sum]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        current_sum -= coins[i - 1]

3. Iterate over each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid while summing up to 295.

1. Define the list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [27, 17, 6, 5, 20, 3, 4, 29, 25, 27, 20, 18, 18, 25, 2, 13, 15, 4, 12, 4, 26, 12, 26, 24, 17, 23, 2, 6, 2, 29, 3, 20, 12, 7, 9, 12, 26, 11, 2, 5, 10, 25, 3, 13, 7, 25]
tax_values = {2: 1, 13: 11, 26: 13, 5: 1, 4: 2, 9: 8, 15: 8, 18: 6, 20: 18, 3: 1, 17: 17, 6: 2, 10: 10, 12: 1, 23: 10, 7: 6, 29: 13, 25: 15, 11: 10, 27: 2, 24: 18}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 295:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 296 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(296):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        if j >= coins[i-1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 295
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i-1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i-1])
        total -= coins[i-1]

To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total tax for each possible subset of coins that adds up to 281. We will then choose the subset with the minimum total tax.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin.
2. Define a function to calculate the total tax for a given subset of coins.
3. Generate all possible subsets of coins that add up to 281.
4. Calculate the total tax for each subset.
5. Choose the subset with the minimum total tax.

Let's start by calculating the total tax for each subset of coins.

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 300 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [30, 24, 27, 14, 29, 17, 4, 21, 20, 14, 19, 23, 18, 4, 12, 9, 24, 26, 21, 17, 3, 13, 25, 20, 16, 12, 2, 9, 17, 5, 6, 24, 13, 11, 6, 15, 13, 5, 13, 25, 10, 15, 10, 3, 2, 18, 7, 23, 5, 18, 21, 6]
tax_values = {14: 11, 3: 1, 18: 5, 21: 1, 27: 2, 19: 14, 6: 6, 25: 8, 5: 3, 29: 4, 7: 6, 24: 10, 10: 2, 13: 9, 9: 1, 11: 8, 16: 10, 2: 1, 12: 12, 15: 4, 23: 17, 17: 9, 26: 13, 30: 17, 4: 3, 20: 6}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 300:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 301 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(301):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        if j >= coins[i-1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 300 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 300
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i-1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i-1])
        total -= coins[i-1]

subset.reverse()

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 273 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {24: 18, 14: 4, 15: 10, 23: 15, 26: 12, 22: 4, 17: 8, 5: 2, 18: 2, 16: 3, 11: 3, 2: 1, 27: 9, 3: 3, 10: 5, 20: 4, 4: 2, 21: 4, 12: 1, 8: 6, 13: 2, 7: 2, 9: 6, 25: 15}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [26, 24, 8, 2, 11, 10, 11, 14, 20, 9, 13, 10, 25, 21, 7, 20, 15, 27, 18, 12, 23, 4, 2, 4, 22, 23, 15, 16, 24, 14, 22, 13, 15, 21, 5, 14, 2, 21, 14, 10, 2, 2, 24, 26, 17, 2, 20, 22, 3, 27, 8, 20, 2, 25, 7]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 273:
dp = [[0, []] for _ in range(274)]

5. Iterate through each coin and update the dp list:
for coin in coins:
    for i in range(273, coin - 1, -1):
        if dp[i - coin][0] + tax_values[coin] < dp[i][0]:
            dp[i] = [dp[i - coin][0] + tax_values[coin], dp[i - coin][1] + [coin]]

6. The final answer is the list of coins that add up to 273 with the minimum total tax paid:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total tax for each possible subset of coins that adds up to 289. We will then select the subset with the minimum total tax.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [25, 22, 26, 12, 18, 12, 5, 6, 6, 21, 28, 26, 6, 26, 9, 11, 27, 24, 16, 1, 12, 5, 10, 23, 11, 10, 28, 2, 3, 7, 23, 28, 27, 12, 3, 3, 27, 21, 13, 8, 18, 25, 6, 7, 9, 25, 18, 18, 23, 12, 11, 15, 2, 16]
tax_values = {10: 6, 24: 14, 5: 3, 3: 1, 16: 6, 27: 10, 13: 1, 12: 4, 21: 17, 8: 2, 28: 10, 6: 3, 1: 1, 18: 2, 25: 14, 11: 3, 23: 7, 7: 6, 26: 16, 15: 4, 2: 1, 9: 3, 22: 8}

2. Generate all possible subsets of coins that add up to 289:
from itertools import combinations
target_sum = 289
valid_subsets = []
for r in range(1, len(coins)+1):
    for subset in combinations(coins, r):
        if sum(subset) == target_sum:
            valid_subsets.append(subset)

3. Calculate the total tax for each subset and keep track of the minimum tax:
min_tax = float('inf')
best_subset = None
for subset in valid_subsets:
    current_tax = sum([tax_values[coin] for coin in subset])
    if current_tax < min_tax:
        min_tax = current_tax
        best_subset = subset

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 284 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [20, 27, 20, 26, 2, 19, 25, 5, 14, 28, 7, 4, 20, 25, 9, 7, 3, 9, 27, 23, 2, 17, 25, 19, 10, 2, 8, 15, 3, 6, 24, 6, 22, 3, 10, 3, 2, 24, 7, 16, 2, 24, 21, 5, 23, 25, 10, 5, 20, 14, 24, 12, 11, 11, 13]
tax_values = {14: 7, 15: 15, 2: 2, 22: 7, 7: 1, 25: 7, 10: 4, 11: 11, 16: 11, 27: 8, 3: 2, 13: 5, 19: 10, 8: 5, 23: 18, 5: 4, 12: 4, 28: 6, 6: 4, 21: 3, 20: 15, 26: 1, 4: 4, 9: 9, 24: 6, 17: 13}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 284:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 285 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(285):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 284 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][284]
j = 284
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        j -= coins[i - 1]

5. Print the final answer in Python list format:

print(subset[::-1])

tax_values = {12: 9, 16: 12, 13: 5, 34: 8, 9: 9, 23: 4, 81: 2, 80: 20, 8: 1, 19: 19, 2: 2, 22: 13, 20: 7, 26: 11, 4: 1, 6: 2, 27: 4, 3: 1, 24: 12}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [2, 27, 9, 80, 20, 81, 13, 24, 16, 6, 26, 12, 3, 26, 20, 8, 16, 8, 20, 22, 9, 34, 23, 8, 12, 34, 4, 6, 22, 19]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 346:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (347) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(347):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

6. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 346 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 346
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

7. Print the final answer in Python list format:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 355 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
   tax_values = {6: 5, 17: 7, 12: 10, 34: 9, 5: 1, 11: 7, 10: 8, 21: 19, 15: 3, 33: 6, 3: 2, 16: 12, 58: 19, 8: 7, 14: 5, 20: 8, 2: 2, 19: 19, 59: 14, 18: 15, 29: 8, 23: 6, 32: 5}

2. Create a list of coins:
   coins = [19, 21, 16, 6, 34, 23, 8, 10, 14, 10, 59, 15, 17, 32, 11, 15, 8, 29, 58, 12, 3, 5, 11, 34, 2, 12, 20, 6, 29, 23, 10, 34, 33, 18]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 355:
   dp = [[float('inf')] * (355 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
   dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
   for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
       for j in range(355 + 1):
           if j >= coins[i - 1]:
               dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 355 with the minimum total tax paid:
   subset = []
   total_tax = dp[len(coins)][355]
   j = 355
   for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
       if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
           subset.append(coins[i - 1])
           j -= coins[i - 1]

   tax_values = {32: 1, 19: 12, 3: 1, 27: 14, 5: 3, 9: 5, 13: 11, 14: 10, 28: 6, 31: 15, 8: 8, 18: 18, 17: 7, 2: 2, 12: 9, 24: 16, 83: 6, 23: 9, 16: 15, 29: 4, 25: 5, 26: 18, 4: 1, 21: 10, 30: 10}

2. Create a list of coins:
   coins = [31, 83, 19, 4, 13, 27, 13, 18, 21, 24, 9, 3, 2, 30, 16, 14, 31, 29, 27, 23, 18, 8, 32, 3, 3, 25, 17, 8, 32, 5, 2, 28, 30, 26, 25, 12, 12]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 335:
   dp = [[float('inf')] * (336) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
   dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
   for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
       for j in range(336):
           if j >= coins[i - 1]:
               dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
           else:
               dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 335 with the minimum total tax paid:
   total_tax = dp[len(coins)][335]
   subset = []
   current_sum = 335
   for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
       if dp[i][current_sum] != dp[i - 1][current_sum]:
           subset.append(coins[i - 1])
           current_sum -= coins[i - 1]

6. The final answer is:
   /answer_list/

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 328 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {1: 1, 31: 13, 25: 13, 11: 3, 3: 1, 10: 8, 33: 14, 8: 4, 9: 9, 4: 1, 20: 4, 12: 8, 27: 13, 30: 14, 16: 10, 18: 9, 32: 5, 21: 20, 6: 4, 5: 5, 22: 11, 17: 11, 19: 2, 14: 10, 15: 6}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 328:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (328 + 1) for _ in range(len(tax_values))]

3. Initialize the first row of the dp table:
for i in range(len(tax_values)):
    dp[i][0] = 0

4. Fill in the dp table using dynamic programming:
for i in range(len(tax_values)):
    for j in range(1, 328 + 1):
        if j >= list(tax_values.keys())[i]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j - list(tax_values.keys())[i]] + list(tax_values.values())[i])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

5. Trace back the coins chosen to minimize the total tax paid:
chosen_coins = []
i, j = len(tax_values) - 1, 328
while i > 0 and j > 0:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 325 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {29: 2, 9: 7, 17: 4, 18: 9, 26: 6, 33: 11, 16: 12, 4: 3, 31: 12, 6: 2, 11: 8, 23: 14, 7: 1, 30: 8, 12: 8, 13: 2, 20: 13, 24: 16, 14: 8, 19: 8, 10: 8, 32: 14, 3: 2, 2: 2, 25: 19, 22: 18, 15: 5, 28: 9}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [12, 26, 9, 14, 11, 25, 28, 17, 18, 18, 9, 16, 2, 11, 31, 25, 4, 23, 9, 3, 24, 22, 3, 14, 32, 30, 19, 7, 4, 22, 33, 13, 25, 15, 14, 28, 20, 3, 4, 3, 32, 10, 6, 29, 25]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 325:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 326 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Initialize a 2D list to store the previous coin index used to achieve the minimum tax:
prev = [[-1] * 326 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]

6. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(326):
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]] < dp[i - 1][j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]]
            prev[i][j] = j - coins[i - 1]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            prev[i][j] = j

7. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 325 with the minimum tax paid:
subset = []
total = 325
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if prev[i][total] != total:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
    total = prev[i][total]

8. Reverse the subset list to get the correct order of coins chosen:
subset.reverse()

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 322 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {11: 1, 14: 4, 7: 2, 25: 4, 12: 5, 20: 19, 13: 6, 15: 11, 30: 18, 1: 1, 2: 2, 31: 6, 10: 2, 23: 1, 6: 2, 21: 18, 18: 8, 28: 15, 17: 5, 26: 6, 22: 6, 9: 1, 19: 2, 5: 4}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [25, 22, 28, 23, 5, 14, 28, 14, 20, 6, 22, 1, 25, 18, 30, 10, 19, 12, 17, 17, 6, 28, 21, 28, 21, 2, 20, 2, 19, 14, 31, 31, 14, 7, 20, 13, 7, 18, 22, 15, 6, 6, 21, 9, 18, 11, 20, 26, 15]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 322:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (322 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(322 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            if (coins[i - 1] < coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 == 0) or (coins[i - 1] >= coins[i - 2] and coins[i - 1] % 2 != 0):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

6. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 322 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
i, j = len(coins), 322
while i > 0 and j > 0:
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        j -= coins[i - 1]
    i -= 1

7. Reverse the subset list to get the coins in the correct order:

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 357 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {30: 12, 20: 19, 16: 7, 24: 14, 12: 3, 13: 4, 8: 2, 2: 1, 21: 2, 23: 12, 34: 13, 27: 16, 3: 3, 28: 3, 14: 13, 6: 4, 33: 17, 10: 8, 5: 3, 15: 12, 4: 2, 18: 2, 19: 5, 17: 1, 32: 2, 25: 12}

2. Create a list to store the coins:
coins = [10, 16, 2, 18, 10, 16, 17, 32, 18, 33, 23, 20, 21, 25, 32, 24, 10, 27, 13, 27, 30, 13, 19, 20, 4, 5, 15, 8, 8, 34, 21, 14, 3, 20, 10, 18, 3, 14, 28, 6, 4, 8, 15, 4, 30, 30, 12, 20, 14, 10]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum up to 357:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (357 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(357 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 357 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][357]
j = 357
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        j -= coins[i - 1]

6. Print the final answer in Python list format:
/answer_list/
print(subset[::-1])

To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total tax for each possible subset of coins that adds up to 351. We will then select the subset with the minimum total tax.

1. Create a list of coins with their tax values:
coins = [30, 4, 10, 25, 2, 20, 23, 22, 29, 13, 21, 23, 23, 24, 3, 26, 29, 27, 15, 18, 28, 10, 22, 24, 2, 22, 13, 32, 8, 28, 31, 13, 27, 6, 35, 2, 20, 25, 24, 2, 16, 31, 3, 5, 23, 32, 24, 20, 13, 7, 11, 12]
tax_values = {10: 8, 32: 8, 25: 5, 7: 2, 30: 9, 18: 3, 5: 2, 35: 14, 2: 1, 15: 10, 12: 6, 29: 14, 23: 12, 31: 14, 11: 3, 8: 7, 21: 5, 13: 3, 28: 3, 6: 1, 3: 2, 4: 2, 22: 5, 16: 9, 24: 4, 27: 16, 26: 6, 20: 20}

2. Generate all possible subsets of coins that add up to 351:
import itertools
subsets = []
for i in range(1, len(coins)+1):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(coins, i):
        if sum(subset) == 351:
            subsets.append(subset)

3. Calculate the total tax for each subset:
total_taxes = []
for subset in subsets:
    total_tax = sum([tax_values[coin] for coin in subset])
    total_taxes.append(total_tax)

4. Find the subset with the minimum total tax:
min_tax_index = total_taxes.index(min(total_taxes))
min_tax_subset = subsets[min_tax_index]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 356 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:

2. Create a function to calculate the total tax paid for a subset of coins:
def calculate_total_tax(coins):
    total_tax = 0
    for coin in coins:
        total_tax += tax_values[coin]
    return total_tax

3. Initialize a list to store the minimum total tax paid for each sum from 0 to 356:
min_tax = [float('inf')] * 357
min_tax[0] = 0

4. Initialize a list to store the coins chosen for each sum from 0 to 356:
chosen_coins = [[] for _ in range(357)]

5. Iterate through each coin in the list of coins:
coins = [35, 14, 9, 23, 25, 24, 21, 20, 12, 17, 12, 5, 2, 17, 25, 25, 26, 31, 7, 21, 10, 2, 27, 19, 32, 29, 11, 33, 3, 27, 17, 3, 18, 14, 2, 32, 14, 21, 12, 8, 3, 34, 13, 12, 2, 23, 13, 3, 3, 31, 23, 23, 6, 30, 30, 11, 21]
for coin in coins:

            chosen_coins[i] = chosen_coins[i - coin] + [coin]

coins = [12, 12, 5, 32, 25, 3, 23, 49, 31, 6, 12, 23, 20, 14, 34, 17, 16, 16, 21, 18, 7, 30, 7, 27, 29, 14, 5, 9, 48, 33, 5, 18, 15, 29, 2, 28, 29, 25, 26, 6, 4, 4, 6, 8, 16, 5, 4, 4, 20, 25, 10, 6, 3, 24, 19]
tax_values = {20: 18, 16: 6, 19: 2, 27: 12, 25: 2, 6: 2, 26: 16, 23: 9, 28: 12, 49: 16, 33: 13, 30: 12, 8: 6, 21: 18, 31: 16, 48: 5, 15: 5, 10: 2, 3: 1, 29: 14, 32: 15, 5: 3, 4: 4, 34: 3, 17: 14, 12: 11, 7: 3, 9: 9, 14: 7, 24: 14, 18: 15, 2: 1}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 348:
dp = [[0 for _ in range(349)] for _ in range(len(coins))]

3. Iterate over the coins and for each coin, iterate over the possible sums from 348 down to the coin value:
for i in range(len(coins)):
    for j in range(348, coins[i]-1, -1):
        if j >= coins[i]:
            if (j - coins[i] == 0) or ((j - coins[i] > 0) and (dp[i][j-coins[i]] != 0)):
                if (j - coins[i] == 0) or ((j - coins[i] > 0) and (coins[i] % 2 == 0 and coins[i] > coins[i-1]) or (coins[i] % 2 != 0 and coins[i] <= coins[i-1])):
                    if dp[i][j] == 0:
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-coins[i]] + tax_values[coins[i]]
                    else:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-coins[i]] + tax_values[coins[i]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 348 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[-1][-1]
for i in range(len(coins)-1, -1, -1):
    if total_tax == 0:
        break
    if dp[i][348] == total_tax:
        subset.append(coins[i])
        total_tax -= tax_values[coins[i]]
        for j in range(348-coins[i], 0, -1):
            if dp[i][j] == total_tax:
                total_tax -= tax_values[coins[i]]
                subset.append(coins[i])
                break

5. Reverse the subset list to get the correct order of coins chosen:
subset.reverse()

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 410 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {13: 11, 18: 8, 36: 15, 11: 4, 6: 1, 16: 8, 100: 12, 39: 10, 28: 9, 27: 20, 103: 6, 19: 5, 30: 14, 2: 1, 4: 3, 3: 3, 15: 10, 8: 5, 7: 2, 14: 14}

2. Create a list of coins:

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 410:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (410 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Initialize a 2D list to store the coins used to achieve the minimum tax paid:
coins_used = [[[] for _ in range(410 + 1)] for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]

6. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(410 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]] < dp[i - 1][j]:

            coins_used[i][j] = coins_used[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + [coins[i - 1]]

            coins_used[i][j] = coins_used[i - 1][j]

7. The minimum tax paid is stored in dp[len(coins)][410], and the coins used to achieve this minimum tax are stored in coins_used[len(coins)][410].

To solve this problem, we will first sort the coins in ascending order based on their values. Then, we will create a dynamic programming table to keep track of the minimum tax paid for each possible sum of values up to 423.

1. Sort the coins based on their values:

2. Initialize a dynamic programming table with size 424 (to include sum 0 to 423) and fill it with maximum possible tax value (19 * 423 = 8037) except for index 0 which will be 0.

3. Iterate through the coins and update the dynamic programming table based on the conditions provided.

4. Backtrack to find the coins that were chosen.

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 400 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {29: 9, 40: 8, 30: 5, 17: 16, 3: 3, 5: 3, 2: 2, 22: 17, 11: 1, 14: 4, 8: 5, 18: 11, 26: 8, 39: 15, 7: 1, 31: 2, 24: 17, 189: 5, 12: 4, 25: 10, 35: 18, 10: 1, 4: 3, 34: 16}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [18, 11, 14, 3, 7, 18, 40, 3, 35, 30, 24, 29, 34, 11, 17, 14, 14, 10, 5, 40, 4, 31, 25, 14, 39, 12, 26, 24, 3, 8, 34, 2, 22, 189, 40]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 400:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (401) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(401):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        if j >= coins[i-1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 400 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 400
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i-1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i-1])
        total -= coins[i-1]

6. Print the final answer in Python list format:

To solve this problem, we will first create a list of tuples containing the coin values and their corresponding tax values. Then, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 384 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of tuples with coin values and tax values:
coins = [(13, 3), (3, 1), (34, 8), (36, 12), (19, 2), (31, 11), (6, 2), (7, 7), (10, 9), (24, 11), (92, 19), (3, 1), (24, 11), (33, 15), (33, 15), (22, 19), (93, 7), (13, 3), (17, 14), (28, 7), (25, 7), (16, 4), (21, 7), (16, 4), (20, 16), (26, 20), (24, 11), (16, 4), (11, 5), (18, 1), (2, 2), (30, 4), (25, 7), (23, 1), (28, 7), (21, 7)]

2. Initialize a dictionary to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 384:
dp = {i: float('inf') for i in range(385)}
dp[0] = 0

3. Initialize a dictionary to store the coins used to achieve the minimum tax for each sum:
coins_used = {i: [] for i in range(385)}

4. Iterate through each coin in the list and update the dp and coins_used dictionaries:
for coin, tax in coins:
    for i in range(384, coin - 1, -1):
        if dp[i - coin] + tax < dp[i] and ((coin < coins_used[i][-1] and coin % 2 == 0) or (coin >= coins_used[i][-1] and coin % 2 != 0)):
            dp[i] = dp[i - coin] + tax
            coins_used[i] = coins_used[i - coin] + [coin]

5. The minimum total tax paid is dp[384], and the coins used to achieve this minimum tax are in coins_used[384].

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 397 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 397:
dp = [[0, []] for _ in range(398)]

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 419 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {13: 8, 29: 10, 4: 4, 2: 2, 77: 17, 16: 10, 11: 2, 22: 18, 17: 10, 18: 18, 38: 7, 9: 6, 5: 2, 41: 14, 31: 3, 12: 10, 19: 5, 24: 16, 40: 6, 14: 4, 34: 13, 15: 3, 23: 20, 76: 16, 37: 2, 21: 2, 28: 3, 10: 2, 30: 16}

2. Sort the list of coins in descending order:
coins = [77, 76, 41, 40, 38, 37, 34, 31, 30, 30, 29, 28, 24, 23, 22, 21, 19, 19, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 15, 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 9, 9, 9, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 419:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (420) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(420):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 419 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 419
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

6. Print the final answer in Python list format:

3. Iterate over each coin in the list and update the dp table:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 396 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {17: 16, 4: 2, 15: 2, 8: 1, 19: 5, 9: 4, 23: 7, 3: 2, 16: 13, 2: 1, 38: 13, 11: 2, 31: 6, 7: 6, 36: 8, 14: 8, 37: 17, 32: 5, 6: 1, 13: 11, 22: 9, 20: 8, 18: 4, 30: 6, 34: 2, 33: 1, 26: 3}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [26, 32, 14, 36, 14, 8, 9, 3, 8, 18, 7, 23, 6, 20, 34, 8, 37, 19, 15, 6, 2, 13, 37, 7, 31, 2, 7, 4, 17, 9, 4, 22, 7, 16, 33, 14, 11, 30, 36, 14, 34, 37, 36, 37, 32, 38, 15, 17, 19, 14]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 396:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (396 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(396 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 396 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 396
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

6. Print the final answer in Python list format:

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 397 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [8, 7, 5, 24, 3, 18, 36, 39, 36, 25, 25, 33, 16, 20, 34, 9, 1, 22, 25, 13, 8, 37, 35, 39, 11, 26, 36, 25, 25, 27, 2, 4, 35, 2, 16, 22, 12, 15, 19, 2, 17, 25, 28, 12, 26, 17, 33, 5, 30, 3, 21, 3]
tax_values = {13: 7, 39: 4, 20: 18, 5: 1, 12: 7, 9: 5, 28: 20, 24: 11, 3: 3, 17: 3, 21: 9, 37: 6, 16: 8, 15: 1, 26: 10, 36: 6, 22: 9, 2: 2, 8: 1, 25: 20, 4: 3, 7: 5, 19: 7, 30: 6, 27: 12, 1: 1, 34: 7, 35: 5, 11: 6, 18: 12, 33: 4}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 397:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (397 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(397 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 397 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][397]
j = 397
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        j -= coins[i - 1]

5. Print the final answer in Python list format:
/answer_list/
print(subset[::-1])

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 411 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [12, 5, 22, 10, 4, 26, 26, 31, 13, 30, 37, 14, 14, 38, 9, 30, 7, 16, 21, 37, 4, 24, 10, 41, 13, 16, 3, 40, 24, 117, 34, 7, 11, 14, 28, 37, 21, 32, 2, 15, 5, 13, 3, 28, 31, 22, 30, 32, 38, 25, 10, 4, 30]
tax_values = {10: 7, 2: 2, 14: 12, 15: 8, 13: 10, 9: 1, 38: 17, 117: 2, 16: 13, 25: 11, 31: 3, 32: 2, 22: 10, 7: 4, 12: 3, 4: 1, 40: 2, 34: 4, 41: 9, 30: 8, 11: 10, 26: 13, 28: 6, 3: 2, 37: 17, 5: 5, 21: 3, 24: 13}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 411:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (411 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(411 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 411 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][411]
current_sum = 411
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][current_sum] != dp[i - 1][current_sum]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        current_sum -= coins[i - 1]

5. Print the final answer in Python list format:
/answer_list/
subset[::-1]  # Reversing the subset list to get the coins in the correct order

/answer_list/

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 426 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 452 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {9: 6, 14: 9, 24: 8, 26: 12, 16: 6, 45: 14, 8: 3, 22: 8, 38: 9, 40: 14, 31: 9, 257: 11, 36: 2, 2: 1, 41: 6, 29: 6, 39: 4}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [38, 36, 40, 31, 39, 29, 36, 31, 16, 14, 16, 45, 40, 45, 257, 8, 39, 16, 2, 41, 9, 26, 22, 24]

3. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 452:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (452 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(452 + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 452 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][452]
j = 452
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        j -= coins[i - 1]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 490 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [31, 8, 22, 27, 2, 25, 2, 8, 49, 26, 65, 6, 37, 49, 15, 21, 27, 5, 34, 28, 47, 15, 7, 42, 32, 20, 34, 48, 39, 7, 13]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 490 with the minimum total tax paid:

while i > 0 and j > 0:
    if dp[i][j] != dp[i-1][j]:

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 449 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [25, 41, 34, 19, 19, 36, 37, 13, 28, 26, 181, 7, 14, 6, 29, 36, 33, 7, 8, 43, 19, 9, 3, 2, 18, 40, 43, 22, 23, 21]
tax_values = {21: 5, 26: 13, 36: 8, 28: 8, 34: 12, 3: 2, 6: 2, 23: 10, 2: 2, 9: 5, 41: 4, 29: 19, 7: 6, 18: 18, 43: 2, 8: 7, 181: 9, 25: 10, 33: 8, 14: 13, 13: 1, 22: 13, 40: 7, 37: 11, 19: 11}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 449:
dp = [[0, []] for _ in range(450)]

3. Iterate over each coin in the list and update the dp list:
for coin in coins:
    for i in range(449, coin - 1, -1):
        if dp[i - coin][0] + tax_values[coin] < dp[i][0]:
            if (i - coin == 0) or ((coin < dp[i - coin][1][-1] and coin % 2 == 0) or (coin >= dp[i - coin][1][-1] and coin % 2 != 0)):
                dp[i] = [dp[i - coin][0] + tax_values[coin], dp[i - coin][1] + [coin]]

4. The final answer is the list of coins that add up to 449 with the minimum total tax paid:

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 453 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {13: 7, 9: 1, 38: 9, 19: 4, 31: 18, 25: 18, 40: 13, 4: 2, 15: 8, 45: 2, 10: 10, 20: 18, 5: 3, 35: 12, 30: 8, 8: 5, 21: 5, 43: 12, 32: 10, 6: 2, 24: 18, 3: 2, 33: 7, 42: 4, 36: 10, 34: 6, 26: 5, 18: 6}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 453:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 454 for _ in range(len(tax_values))]

3. Initialize the first row of dp with the tax values for the coins that have a value of 1:
for coin, tax in tax_values.items():
    if coin == 1:
        dp[coin][coin] = tax

4. Iterate through the coins and update the dp table:
for coin in sorted(tax_values.keys()):
    for i in range(1, 454):
        if coin <= i:
            dp[coin][i] = min(dp[coin][i], tax_values[coin] + dp[coin][i - coin])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 453 with the minimum total tax paid:
total = 453
coins_chosen = []
while total > 0:
    for coin in sorted(tax_values.keys(), reverse=True):
        if dp[coin][total] != float('inf') and (not coins_chosen or (coin % 2 == 0 and coin < coins_chosen[-1]) or (coin % 2 != 0 and coin >= coins_chosen[-1])):
            coins_chosen.append(coin)
            total -= coin
            break

6. Finally, present the solution as a Python list:

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 445 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
   coin_tax = {36: 14, 27: 19, 21: 6, 13: 8, 23: 17, 26: 17, 15: 6, 25: 7, 31: 20, 30: 5, 18: 14, 12: 6, 37: 2, 221: 18, 14: 13, 24: 10, 33: 4, 43: 11, 29: 18, 40: 1, 7: 6, 17: 2}

2. Create a list of coins:
   coins = [36, 40, 17, 7, 15, 23, 18, 26, 29, 24, 15, 43, 13, 12, 31, 33, 30, 31, 26, 37, 14, 31, 43, 25, 30, 7, 37, 27, 221, 13, 26, 21]

3. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 445:
   dp = [[float('inf')] * 446 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
   dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
   for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
       for j in range(446):
           if j >= coins[i - 1]:
               dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + coin_tax[coins[i - 1]])
           else:

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 445 with the minimum total tax paid:

   total_tax = dp[len(coins)][445]
   current_sum = 445
   for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 474 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [21, 13, 10, 18, 21, 43, 42, 29, 14, 19, 9, 2, 15, 19, 32, 45, 24, 31, 25, 7, 21, 24, 29, 29, 4, 36, 29, 19, 29, 12, 3, 44, 40, 46, 33, 3, 28, 44, 25, 6, 36, 3, 4, 19, 31]
tax_values = {6: 3, 9: 7, 13: 11, 19: 11, 36: 17, 32: 11, 46: 1, 4: 3, 21: 14, 3: 1, 18: 5, 29: 18, 12: 9, 2: 2, 15: 14, 43: 11, 24: 5, 25: 15, 14: 10, 42: 11, 44: 7, 31: 11, 40: 2, 33: 10, 45: 20, 7: 6, 10: 3, 28: 5}

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to keep track of the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 474:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (475) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(475):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 474 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 474
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i - 1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        total -= coins[i - 1]

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid while summing up to 488.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:

dp = [[float('inf')] * (489) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

4. Iterate over each coin and update the dp table:

        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])

5. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that minimizes the total tax paid:
subset = []

    if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 452 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a dictionary to store the tax values for each coin:
tax_values = {37: 2, 38: 4, 30: 18, 39: 18, 14: 1, 18: 1, 4: 1, 10: 8, 21: 10, 6: 5, 42: 13, 32: 10, 25: 2, 17: 15, 13: 2, 9: 4, 22: 17, 7: 5, 3: 2, 54: 7, 19: 15, 8: 2, 36: 17, 28: 6, 5: 5, 41: 9, 57: 12}

2. Create a list of coins:
coins = [39, 3, 38, 10, 3, 5, 6, 14, 32, 7, 30, 28, 17, 9, 8, 13, 17, 41, 25, 6, 19, 36, 5, 36, 8, 38, 6, 19, 25, 3, 22, 18, 3, 21, 57, 37, 42, 30, 54, 13, 36, 6, 13, 17, 10, 4, 36]

3. Sort the coins in descending order:
coins.sort(reverse=True)

4. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 452:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (452 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

5. Initialize a 2D list prev to store the previous coin used to achieve the minimum tax:
prev = [[-1] * (452 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]

6. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(452 + 1):
        if j >= coins[i - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]] < dp[i - 1][j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]]
            prev[i][j] = j - coins[i - 1]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            prev[i][j] = j

7. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 452 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
i = len(coins)
j = 452
while i > 0 and j > 0:
    if prev[i][j] != j:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
    j = prev[i][j]
    i -= 1

8. Print the subset of coins in Python list format:

subset[::-1]

tax_values = {44: 2, 1: 1, 36: 14, 26: 2, 22: 10, 33: 13, 16: 12, 23: 1, 41: 6, 8: 6, 18: 3, 13: 5, 2: 2, 7: 5, 29: 13, 25: 19, 3: 1, 45: 12, 35: 13, 17: 6, 47: 13, 10: 8, 15: 14, 31: 13, 4: 2, 14: 2, 32: 11, 40: 3, 11: 4, 28: 7, 37: 12, 27: 11, 19: 17, 38: 18}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 465:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (465 + 1) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate over each coin and update the minimum tax paid for each sum:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(466):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 465 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][465]
current_sum = 465
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][current_sum] != dp[i - 1][current_sum]:
        subset.append(coins[i - 1])
        current_sum -= coins[i - 1]

5. Print the final answer in Python list format:

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:

2. Initialize a 2D list dp to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 449:
dp = [[float('inf')] * 450 for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(450):
        if j >= coins[i - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - coins[i - 1]] + tax_values[coins[i - 1]])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 449 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total_tax = dp[len(coins)][449]
current_sum = 449
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the subset of coins that add up to 477 with the minimum total tax paid.

1. Create a list of coins and their tax values:
coins = [26, 8, 34, 12, 20, 21, 35, 13, 28, 5, 16, 11, 24, 42, 16, 12, 34, 21, 27, 27, 20, 47, 9, 12, 38, 23, 43, 33, 26, 22, 38, 42, 20, 41, 47, 41, 24, 46, 35, 42, 9, 35, 13, 45, 24, 29, 45, 2, 41, 39, 24, 38, 39, 18, 5, 8, 36]
tax_values = {12: 8, 18: 6, 42: 8, 11: 9, 38: 13, 9: 9, 24: 15, 34: 1, 20: 5, 2: 2, 23: 2, 33: 12, 27: 8, 39: 11, 16: 1, 28: 12, 26: 11, 21: 7, 35: 7, 22: 19, 47: 9, 29: 12, 46: 3, 45: 9, 5: 1, 13: 13, 43: 8, 36: 11, 41: 4, 8: 8}

2. Initialize a 2D list to store the minimum tax paid for each sum from 0 to 477:
dp = [[float('inf')] * (478) for _ in range(len(coins) + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0

3. Iterate through each coin and update the dp table:
for i in range(1, len(coins) + 1):
    for j in range(478):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        if j >= coins[i-1]:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-coins[i-1]] + tax_values[coins[i-1]])

4. Backtrack to find the subset of coins that add up to 477 with the minimum total tax paid:
subset = []
total = 477
for i in range(len(coins), 0, -1):
    if dp[i][total] != dp[i-1][total]:
        subset.append(coins[i-1])
        total -= coins[i-1]
