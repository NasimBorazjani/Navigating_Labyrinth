Each row and column represents a city, and a '1' signifies a direct road from the city of the row to the city of the column. The travel time between any two directly connected cities is the same. Currently, we are located in city 'O'. Our task is to visit city B and city H excatly twice. Determine the quickest route that allows us to visit both these destination cities, ensuring that we stop at the two destinations twice on our path. The sequence in which we visit the destination cities is not important. However, apart from H and B, we can only visit each city once on our path.

 An exmaple implementation of the target initialize function. Crucial: the value of variables must be updated according to the problem statement, the implemention above has hypothetical values: 
```python
def initialize():
   # Define the adjacency matrix representing the directed graph
   adjacency_matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
