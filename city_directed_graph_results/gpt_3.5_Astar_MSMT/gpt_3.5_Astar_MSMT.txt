Explanation:
1. The `initialize` function sets up the problem by defining the adjacency matrix representing the connections between cities, the list of cities, and the start city. It also initializes the visited_costs dictionary to keep track of the cost of reaching each city and the priority queue with the start city.
2. The `a_star` function implements the A* search algorithm to find the quickest route to visit cities 'H' and 'Z' exactly twice each. It iterates through the priority queue, expanding the current city's neighbors, updating the costs, and adding them back to the queue.
3. The algorithm stops when both destination cities have been visited twice and returns the path taken, including the start city.

Determine the quickest route that allows us to visit both these destination cities, ensuring that we stop at the two destinations twice on our path. The sequence in which we visit the destination cities is not important. However, apart from A and R, we can only visit each city once on our path. Provide the solution as a list of the city names on our path, including the start, in Python syntax.\n\n  R L F E D Q G U H T Z A \nR 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 \nL 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 \nF 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nE 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 \nD 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 \nQ 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 \nG 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 \nU 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 \nH 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nT 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 \nZ 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 \nA 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \n", 'is_feasible': [[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], ['R', 'L', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'Q', 'G', 'U', 'H', 'T', 'Z', 'A'], 'R', 'A'], 'is_correct': [[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], ['R', 'L', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'Q', 'G', 'U', 'H', 'T', 'Z', 'A'], 'F', 'R', 'A'], 'Astar': ['[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]', "['R', 'L', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'Q', 'G', 'U', 'H', 'T', 'Z', 'A']", "['F']", "['R', 'A']"], 'opt': [['F', 'Q', 'R', 'Z', 'R', 'G', 'L', 'A', 'D', 'A'], 10, 0.030649185180664062]}
