Determine the quickest route that allows us to visit both these destination cities, ensuring that we stop at the two destinations twice on our path. The sequence in which we visit the destination cities is not important. However, apart from K and Z, we can only visit each city once on our path. Provide the solution as a list of the city names on our path, including the start, in Python syntax.\n\n  K B Z S X H O E U V \nK 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 \nB 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \nZ 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 \nS 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 \nX 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \nH 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 \nO 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \nE 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 \nU 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \nV 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n", 'is_feasible': [[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], ['K', 'B', 'Z', 'S', 'X', 'H', 'O', 'E', 'U', 'V'], 'Z', 'K'], 'is_correct': [[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], ['K', 'B', 'Z', 'S', 'X', 'H', 'O', 'E', 'U', 'V'], 'H', 'Z', 'K'], 'Astar': ['[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]', "['K', 'B', 'Z', 'S', 'X', 'H', 'O', 'E', 'U', 'V']", "['H']", "['Z', 'K']"], 'opt': [['H', 'O', 'X', 'K', 'E', 'K', 'Z', 'S', 'Z'], 9, 0.03679943084716797]}
