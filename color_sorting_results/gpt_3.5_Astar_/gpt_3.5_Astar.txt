This A* search algorithm is designed to solve the 'Sort It' game by finding the shortest list of moves to sort the balls by color. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first. The heuristic function calculates the number of balls that are not in the correct position, which helps guide the search towards the goal state.

The `a_star` function initializes the initial state, visited costs, and the priority queue. It then iterates through the queue, generating possible actions and updating the state based on moving balls between tubes. If the tubes are sorted, the function returns the list of actions. Otherwise, it continues exploring states.

The `heuristic` function calculates the heuristic value based on the number of balls that are not in the correct position. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the algorithm finds the optimal solution efficiently.

The final output is a list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the balls. Each tuple contains the index of the tube from which a ball is taken and the index of the tube to which it is moved.

Explanation:
1. Import the heapq module to use priority queues for the A* search algorithm.
2. Define the function `a_star()` to solve the 'Sort It' game.
3. Define the initial state of the tubes, the number of tubes, the tube capacity, and the goal state.
4. Initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state.
5. Initialize a priority queue with the initial state as the first element, along with the cost, actions taken, and the state.
6. While there are states in the queue, pop the state with the lowest cost.
7. Check if the current state is the goal state, if so, return the actions taken.
8. Generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top ball from one tube to another.
9. Check if the move is valid, i.e., the from_tube is not empty and the to_tube is not full.
10. Generate the new state after the move by updating the tubes.
11. Calculate the cost of the new state.
12. Check if the new state is not visited or the new cost is lower, then update the visited costs and add the new state to the queue.
13. Return None if no solution is found.
14. Print the list of tuples representing the moves to sort the balls.

ID: 100
{'difficulty': 12, 'statement': "The game of 'Sort It' begins with 3 tubes, each filled with 6 balls of different colors. The goal is to sort the balls by color, with each tube containing balls of only one color. Only one ball can be moved at a time, taken from the top of one tube and placed on top of another. The capacity of each tube (maximum number of balls we can fit in each tube) is 9 balls. It is not allowed to place a ball in a tube that already has 9 balls. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the tube from which a ball is taken and, second, the index of the tube to which it is moved, indexing from 0.
