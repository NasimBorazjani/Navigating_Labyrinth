This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic. The code generates all possible moves from the current state and checks if the new state is the goal state. If it is, it returns the actions taken to reach the goal state. If it is not, it adds the new state to the queue of states to be visited if it has not been visited before or if the new cost to reach it is lower than the previously recorded cost. The code continues this process until it finds the goal state or until there are no more states to visit.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and only updates this cost if it finds a lower-cost path to the node. The algorithm terminates when it finds the goal node, and it returns the path to the goal node.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. It starts with the initial state of the tubes and tries to reach the goal state by moving the balls between the tubes. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of misplaced balls in each tube. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and only explores the states that have not been visited or can be reached with a lower cost. The solution is a list of tuples representing the moves of the balls between the tubes.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and selects the node with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal. The heuristic function must be admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from a node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal) for the algorithm to guarantee the shortest path.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible and consistent.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic. The code generates all possible moves from the current state and checks if the new state is the goal state. If it is, it returns the actions taken to reach the goal state. If it is not, it adds the new state to the queue of states to be visited, with a priority equal to the total cost of reaching that state. The code continues this process until it finds the goal state or until there are no more states to visit.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of misplaced balls in each tube. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The priority queue ensures that states with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal are explored first. The algorithm stops when it finds a state that matches the goal state and returns the sequence of moves to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is non-decreasing along the path). The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only updates it if a lower cost is found. The priority queue ensures that the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal is explored next.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from a node to the goal is non-decreasing along a path). The code generates all possible moves from the current state, checks if each move is valid (the tube to move from is not empty and the tube to move to is not full), and adds the new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states if it is unvisited or if a lower cost path to it is found. The code returns the list of moves when the goal state is reached.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node, and it updates this cost if it finds a cheaper path to a node. The algorithm terminates when it visits the goal node.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic. The code generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to a priority queue, with the priority being the total cost. It continues this process until it finds the goal state, at which point it returns the list of moves required to reach the goal state.

The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is non-decreasing along the path). The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only updates this cost if a lower cost path is found. The priority queue ensures that states are visited in order of increasing estimated total cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost).

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost). The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and the moves required to reach each node. It generates all possible moves from the current state and adds the new states to a priority queue. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or there are no more states to visit. The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The solution is returned as a list of tuples, each representing a move of a ball from one tube to another.

In this code, we first define the initial and goal states of the puzzle. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The priority of each element in the queue is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimate remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. We then start a while loop to iterate over the queue until it is empty. In each iteration, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach this state. Otherwise, we generate all valid actions from the current state, which includes moving the top ball from any tube to the top of any other tube. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The result is a list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the balls.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it prioritizes nodes with lower total cost (cost so far + estimated cost to goal). The heuristic function used in this code is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic. The code generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to a priority queue, with the priority being the total cost. It continues this process until it finds the goal state, at which point it returns the list of moves taken to reach the goal state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls by color. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of balls not in their correct position, which is both admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is non-decreasing along the path). The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only updates it if a new path with a lower cost is found. The priority queue ensures that the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal is explored next.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls by color. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The solution is returned as a list of tuples, each representing a move from one tube to another.

This code will return the shortest list of moves to sort the balls by color in each tube. The heuristic function used in the A* algorithm is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible and consistent. The admissibility of the heuristic ensures that the A* algorithm will find the optimal solution, and its consistency guarantees that A* will be efficient in finding this solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls by color. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and only updates it if a lower cost is found. The priority queue ensures that the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal is explored first.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of misplaced balls in each tube. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The priority queue ensures that the state with the lowest estimated total cost (cost so far + heuristic estimate) is explored next. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal state and returns the sequence of moves to reach the goal state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls in the tubes. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is both admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and only explores new states or states that can be reached with a lower cost. The result is a list of tuples representing the moves required to reach the goal state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to sort the balls by color. The heuristic function used is the sum of the number of misplaced balls in each tube, which is admissible and consistent. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only adds a new state to the queue of not-yet-visited states if it is unvisited or if a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found. The algorithm stops when it finds a state that is the goal state and returns the sequence of moves to reach this state.
