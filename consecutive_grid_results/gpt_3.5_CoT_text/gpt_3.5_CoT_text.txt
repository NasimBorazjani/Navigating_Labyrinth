The initial state of the grid is:

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner is 39 + 72 + 73 = 184.

To minimize the sum, we need to replace 'x' with values that are closer to the range of 39 to 87.

1. Replace 'x' at (0, 0) with 41:
 [['41' '57' 'x']
 ['42' 'x' '72']
 ['39' 'x' '73']]

The sum is now 41 + 72 + 73 = 186.

2. Replace 'x' at (0, 2) with 87:
 [['41' '57' '87']
 ['42' 'x' '72']
 ['39' 'x' '73']]

The sum is now 41 + 72 + 73 = 186.

3. Replace 'x' at (1, 1) with 62:
 [['41' '57' '87']
 ['42' '62' '72']
 ['39' 'x' '73']]

The sum is now 41 + 72 + 73 = 186.

4. Replace 'x' at (2, 1) with 66:
 [['41' '57' '87']
 ['42' '62' '72']
 ['39' '66' '73']]

The sum is now 41 + 72 + 73 = 186.

The final state of the grid after replacements is:
 [['41' '57' '87']
 ['42' '62' '72']
 ['39' '66' '73']]

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner is 41 + 72 + 73 = 186.

The initial state of the grid is:

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner is 52 + 53 + 20 = 125.

To minimize the sum, we need to replace 'x' with 18 in position (0, 0) because 18 is the smallest number in the given range. This will reduce the sum to 52 + 53 + 18 = 123.

After replacing 'x' with 18 in position (0, 0), the updated grid is:

Grid:
 [['18' '60' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' '53']
 ['52' '39' '20']]

The next step is to replace 'x' with 71 in position (0, 2) to maintain the increasing order in the first row. This replacement does not affect the sum, which remains 123.

After replacing 'x' with 71 in position (0, 2), the updated grid is:

The initial state of the grid is:

Grid:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x's with unique numbers from the range 34 to 87 while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. The replacements should be done in a way that minimizes the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the rightmost column, and the diagonal connecting the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

1. Replace the 'x' at (0, 0) with 34 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.
2. Replace the 'x' at (1, 1) with 87 to maintain the decreasing order in the second column.
3. Replace the 'x' at (2, 1) with 65 to maintain the increasing order in the third column.
4. Replace the 'x' at (1, 2) with 79 to maintain the decreasing order in the second row.
5. Replace the 'x' at (2, 2) with 73 to maintain the decreasing order in the third row.
6. Replace the 'x' at (0, 2) with 50 to maintain the increasing order in the first column.

After these replacements, the grid becomes:

Grid:
 [['34' 'x' '50']
 ['65' '79' 'x']
 ['79' '73' '50']]

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the rightmost column, and the diagonal connecting the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner is 34 + 50 + 79 + 73 = 236.

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner is 27 + 37 + 61 + 64 = 189.

To minimize this sum, we need to replace the 'x's with numbers from the given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column.

1. Replace the 'x' at (1, 1) with 33:
 [['27' '37' 'x' 'x']

 ['30' '33' '38' 'x']
 ['32' '44' '53' '61']

 ['30' '33' '38' '39']
 ['32' '44' '53' '61']
 ['33' '54' 'x' '64']]

5. Replace the 'x' at (3, 2) with 58:
 [['27' '37' '34' 'x']
 ['30' '33' '38' '39']
 ['32' '44' '53' '61']

 ['30' '33' '38' '39']
 ['32' '44' '53' '61']

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner is 27 + 39 + 61 + 64 = 191.

The initial state of the grid is:

[['x' '36' 'x' '55']
 ['30' '34' 'x' '56']
 ['x' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['x' '32' '46' 'x']]

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Replace the 'x' at (0, 0) with 20 to maintain the increasing order in the first row: [['20' '36' 'x' '55']
 ['30' '34' 'x' '56']
 ['x' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['x' '32' '46' 'x']]

2. Replace the 'x' at (2, 0) with 40 to maintain the increasing order in the third column: [['20' '36' 'x' '55']
 ['30' '34' 'x' '56']
 ['40' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['x' '32' '46' 'x']]

3. Replace the 'x' at (3, 0) with 50 to maintain the increasing order in the fourth column: [['20' '36' 'x' '55']
 ['30' '34' 'x' '56']
 ['40' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['50' '32' '46' 'x']]

 ['30' '34' 'x' '56']
 ['40' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['50' '32' '46' 'x']]

5. Replace the 'x' at (1, 2) with 38 to maintain the increasing order in the second row: [['20' '36' '22' '55']
 ['30' '34' '38' '56']
 ['40' '33' 'x' '57']
 ['50' '32' '46' 'x']]

6. Replace the 'x' at (2, 2) with 44 to maintain the increasing order in the third row: [['20' '36' '22' '55']
 ['30' '34' '38' '56']
 ['40' '33' '44' '57']
 ['50' '32' '46' 'x']]

7. Replace the 'x' at (3, 3) with 52 to maintain the increasing order in the fourth column: [['20' '36' '22' '55']
 ['30' '34' '38' '56']
 ['40' '33' '44' '57']

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
The first step is to replace the 'x' in the top row with the smallest possible number, which is 44. This will minimize the sum of the top row. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['x' '67' 'x' 'x']
 ['60' 'x' '79' '80']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The next step is to replace the 'x' in the second row with the smallest possible number, which is 66. This will minimize the sum of the rightmost column. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' 'x' 'x']
 ['60' 'x' '79' '80']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The next step is to replace the 'x' in the second column with the smallest possible number, which is 56. This will minimize the sum of the diagonal connecting the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' '56' 'x']
 ['60' 'x' '79' '80']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The next step is to replace the 'x' in the third column with the smallest possible number, which is 78. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' '56' '78']
 ['60' 'x' '79' '80']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The next step is to replace the 'x' in the third row with the smallest possible number, which is 61. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' '56' '78']
 ['60' '61' '79' '80']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The next step is to replace the 'x' in the fourth row with the smallest possible number, which is 81. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' '56' '78']
 ['60' '61' '79' '80']
 ['81' 'x' 'x' '83']]

The final step is to replace the 'x' in the fourth column with the smallest possible number, which is 82. The updated grid after this step is:

Grid:
 [['45' '55' '59' '44']
 ['66' '67' '56' '78']

 [['x' 'x' '63' 'x']
 ['x' '53' '57' '73']
 ['x' 'x' '56' 'x']
 ['42' 'x' 'x' '68']]

To minimize the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, rightmost column, and diagonal, we need to replace the 'x's with numbers in the given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Replace the 'x' at (0, 0) with 40 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.
2. Replace the 'x' at (0, 1) with 44 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.
3. Replace the 'x' at (2, 0) with 48 to maintain the increasing order in the third row.
4. Replace the 'x' at (1, 1) with 52 to maintain the increasing order in the second row.
5. Replace the 'x' at (2, 1) with 60 to maintain the increasing order in the third row.
6. Replace the 'x' at (3, 1) with 64 to maintain the increasing order in the fourth row.
7. Replace the 'x' at (2, 3) with 72 to maintain the increasing order in the third row.
8. Replace the 'x' at (0, 3) with 76 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.

After these replacements, the grid becomes:

Grid:
 [['40' '44' '63' '76']
 ['x' '53' '57' '73']
 ['48' '60' '56' '72']
 ['42' '64' 'x' '68']]

The sum of the numbers in the topmost row (40 + 44 + 63 + 76), rightmost column (76 + 73 + 72 + 68), and the diagonal (40 + 53 + 56 + 68) is minimized.

The answer is /answer_list/[(0, 0, 40), (0, 1, 44), (2, 0, 48), (1, 1, 52), (2, 1, 60), (3, 1, 64), (2, 3, 72), (0, 3, 76)]

The initial state of the grid is as follows: \n\nGrid:\n [['69' '70' 'x' 'x']\n ['64' '66' 'x' '75']\n ['62' '64' 'x' 'x']\n ['60' 'x' '48' '46']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['69', '70', '', ''], ['64', '66', '', '75'], ['62', '64', '', ''], ['60', '', '48', '46']]", 41, 86], 'is_correct': ["[['69', '70', '', ''], ['64', '66', '', '75'], ['62', '64', '', ''], ['60', '', '48', '46']]", 41, 86], 'Astar': ["[['69', '70', '', ''], ['64', '66', '', '75'], ['62', '64', '', ''], ['60', '', '48', '46']]", '41', '86'], 'opt': [[[0, 2, 71], [0, 3, 76], [1, 2, 68], [2, 2, 65], [2, 3, 67], [3, 1, 49]], 796, 0.6638424396514893]}

The first step is to identify the 'x' values that can be determined based on the strictly increasing or decreasing order in rows and columns. By observing the grid, we can determine the following replacements:

1. Replace the 'x' at (0, 2) with 71 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.
2. Replace the 'x' at (0, 3) with 72 to maintain the increasing order in the first row.
3. Replace the 'x' at (2, 2) with 63 to maintain the increasing order in the third row.
4. Replace the 'x' at (3, 1) with 58 to maintain the decreasing order in the fourth column.

After these replacements, the updated grid looks like this:

Grid:
 [['69' '70' '71' '72']
 ['64' '66' 'x' '75']
 ['62' '64' '63' 'x']
 ['60' '58' '48' '46']]

Next, we need to minimize the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the numbers in the rightmost column, and the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. To achieve this, we can swap the values at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to minimize the sum.

5. Replace the 'x' at (0, 1) with 70 to minimize the sum.

After this final replacement, the updated grid looks like this:

Grid:
 [['69' '71' '70' '72']
 ['64' '66' 'x' '75']
 ['62' '64' '63' 'x']
 ['60' '58' '48' '46']]

The answer is /answer_list/[(0, 2, 71), (0, 3, 72), (2, 2, 63), (3, 1, 58), (0, 1, 70)]

The first step is to identify the cells that need to be replaced to minimize the sum of the numbers in the specified way. The topmost row contains x, 53, 60, 67 and the rightmost column contains 67, x, x, x.

1. Replace the 'x' at (0, 0) with 28 to minimize the sum: [('0', '0', 28)]

After replacing the 'x' at (0, 0) with 28, the grid becomes:

Grid:
 [['28' '53' '60' '67']
 ['x' 'x' '72' 'x']
 ['50' '56' '74' 'x']
 ['54' '65' '76' 'x']]

The next step is to identify the next cell to replace to continue minimizing the sum.

2. Replace the 'x' at (1, 0) with 33 to minimize the sum: [('1', '0', 33)]

After replacing the 'x' at (1, 0) with 33, the grid becomes:

Grid:
 [['28' '53' '60' '67']
 ['33' 'x' '72' 'x']
 ['50' '56' '74' 'x']
 ['54' '65' '76' 'x']]

The process continues until all 'x's are replaced with unique numbers to minimize the sum.

3. Replace the 'x' at (1, 1) with 49 to minimize the sum: [('1', '1', 49)]
4. Replace the 'x' at (1, 3) with 62 to minimize the sum: [('1', '3', 62)]
5. Replace the 'x' at (3, 3) with 78 to minimize the sum: [('3', '3', 78)]
6. Replace the 'x' at (2, 3) with 68 to minimize the sum: [('2', '3', 68)]
7. Replace the 'x' at (2, 0) with 39 to minimize the sum: [('2', '0', 39)]
8. Replace the 'x' at (3, 2) with 71 to minimize the sum: [('3', '2', 71)]
9. Replace the 'x' at (3, 1) with 59 to minimize the sum: [('3', '1', 59)]
10. Replace the 'x' at (2, 1) with 45 to minimize the sum: [('2', '1', 45)]

After all replacements, the final grid becomes:

The first step is to identify the 'x' positions that can be filled with the given range of numbers while maintaining the increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. 

1. Replace 'x' at (0, 1) with 69: 
Grid:
 [['71' '69' '57' 'x']
 ['67' '68' 'x' '73']
 ['51' 'x' '72' 'x']

 ['67' '68' 'x' '73']
 ['51' 'x' '72' 'x']
 ['50' 'x' '75' 'x']]

3. Replace 'x' at (1, 2) with 66: 
Grid:
 [['71' '69' '57' '39']
 ['67' '68' '66' '73']
 ['51' 'x' '72' 'x']
 ['50' 'x' '75' 'x']]

4. Replace 'x' at (2, 1) with 70: 
Grid:
 [['71' '69' '57' '39']
 ['67' '68' '66' '73']
 ['51' '70' '72' 'x']

5. Replace 'x' at (3, 1) with 74: 
Grid:
 [['71' '69' '57' '39']
 ['67' '68' '66' '73']
 ['51' '70' '72' 'x']

5. Replace the 'x' at (0, 2) with 60 to maintain the increasing order in the first row: [['82' '58' '60' '77']
 ['x' '49' '63' '70']
 ['78' '59' 'x' '69']
