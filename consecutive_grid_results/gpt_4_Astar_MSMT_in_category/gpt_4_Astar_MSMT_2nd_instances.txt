The replacements must maintain the consecutive order in each row and column. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner should be minimized. The solution should be given as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should represent the replacement of a number with an  'x' number and contain three elements: the row index of the 'x', the column index  of the 'x' (both starting from 0), and the value of the number that replaces the 'x'.
