This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the problem of filling in the 'x' values in a 3x3 grid with unique numbers from a given range while maintaining the consecutive order in each row and column. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal of the grid to minimize this sum. The algorithm explores possible replacements for 'x' values and selects the replacement that minimizes the heuristic value. The final solution is returned as a list of tuples representing the replacements made.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the given problem of filling in the 'x' cells in a 3x3 grid with unique numbers from a given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. The heuristic used is the sum of the minimum possible values that can be placed in the remaining 'x' cells. The code iterates through each 'x' cell in the grid, replacing it with a number from the available unique numbers and calculating the cost based on the sum of the top row, right column, and diagonal. The goal is to minimize this cost. The code returns the list of tuples representing the replacements made to fill in the 'x' cells.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the problem of replacing 'x' values in a 3x3 grid with unique integers from a given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal to minimize the sum of these values. The algorithm explores possible replacements for 'x' values and selects the path with the minimum cost to reach the goal state.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the given problem of filling in the 'x' values in a 3x3 grid with unique integers from a given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. The heuristic function calculates the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state, along with the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, rightmost column, and diagonal. The cost function calculates the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, rightmost column, and diagonal for a given state. The main A* search function generates all possible actions for each state, replacing 'x' with available unique integers, and selects the action with the lowest cost and heuristic value to reach the goal state.

In the A* search algorithm implementation for the given problem, the code starts by defining the initial grid state, the range of numbers that can replace 'x' in the grid, and the initial state as a tuple of the grid and the set of available numbers.

The `visited_costs` dictionary is used to keep track of the cost of reaching each visited state. The initial state is added to the dictionary with a cost of 0.

The priority queue `queue` is initialized with the initial state and an initial cost of 0. Each element in the queue is a tuple containing the total cost, the cost so far, the actions taken, and the current state.

The algorithm then enters a loop where it continues to explore states until there are no more states to visit. In each iteration, it pops the state with the lowest total cost from the queue.

The algorithm then unpacks the grid and available numbers from the current state and checks if there are any unknown numbers ('x') left in the grid. If there are no more unknown numbers, the algorithm returns the actions taken.

If there are still unknown numbers in the grid, the algorithm generates all possible actions by iterating over each cell in the grid and each available number that can replace 'x'. It creates a new grid and set of available numbers by replacing 'x' with the new number and removing that number from the set.

The new state is then calculated, and the cost of the new state is determined based on the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal. If the new state has not been visited before or the new cost is lower than the cost of the previous visit, the new state is added to the queue.

The heuristic function calculates the heuristic value for a given grid state as the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal.

Finally, the algorithm returns the list of actions taken to replace 'x' with unique integers in the grid to minimize the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the given problem of filling in the 'x' values in a 3x3 grid with unique numbers from a given range while maintaining the strictly increasing or decreasing order in each row and column. The heuristic used is the sum of the minimum possible values that can be placed in the remaining unknown cells. The code iterates through all possible actions of replacing 'x' with available numbers and calculates the cost based on the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, rightmost column, and diagonal. The goal is to minimize this sum while ensuring a valid solution.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the problem of replacing 'x's in a 3x3 grid with unique integers from a given range while maintaining the consecutive order in each row and column. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal to minimize the total sum. The algorithm explores possible replacements for 'x's and selects the one that minimizes the total sum.

In the code above, we first define the initial state of the grid and the set of available numbers that can replace the 'x' values. We then encode the initial state as a tuple of the grid and the set of available numbers. The `visited_costs` dictionary is used to keep track of the cost to reach each visited state.

The A* search algorithm is implemented using a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost. We iterate through the grid to find the 'x' values and generate all possible actions by replacing each 'x' with a unique number from the available set of numbers. We create a new state by updating the grid and the set of available numbers, calculate the cost of the new state, and add it to the priority queue.

The heuristic function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal of the grid. This heuristic is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state and guide the search towards the optimal solution.

Finally, the A* algorithm returns the list of tuples representing the replacements of 'x' values with unique numbers that minimize the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal.

{'difficulty': 9, 'statement': "We have a 3x3 numerical grid, with numbers ranging from 34 to 87. The numbers in each row and column must be strictly increasing or decreasing.

This implementation uses the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution to the problem of replacing 'x's in the grid with unique integers while maintaining the consecutive order in each row and column. The heuristic function calculates the sum of the remaining available numbers to be placed in the grid, and the cost function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal. The program returns the list of tuples representing the replacements of 'x's with numbers to minimize the specified sum.

This code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the problem of replacing 'x's in a 4x4 grid with unique integers from a given range while maintaining the consecutive order in each row and column. The heuristic used is the sum of the minimum possible values that can replace the remaining 'x's in the grid. The program returns the list of tuples representing the replacement of 'x's with numbers.

In the code above, we first define the initial state of the grid and the range of numbers that can replace the 'x' values. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue to store the states not yet visited. The initial state is added to the queue with a cost of 0.

The A* search algorithm proceeds by popping the state with the lowest cost from the queue, generating all possible actions from that state, and updating the queue with the new states. The algorithm continues until all 'x' values are replaced with numbers.

The `calculate_cost` function calculates the sum of the numbers in the top row, rightmost column, and diagonal of the grid. This sum is used to evaluate the cost of each state.

The `heuristic` function calculates an admissible and consistent heuristic by summing the differences between the numbers in the grid and the nearest numbers in the range. This heuristic helps guide the search towards the optimal solution.

Finally, the `a_star` function returns the list of tuples representing the replacements of 'x' values with unique integers that minimize the sum of the numbers in the specified rows and diagonal.
