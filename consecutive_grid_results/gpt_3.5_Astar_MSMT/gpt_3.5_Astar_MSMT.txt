{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "We have a 3x3 numerical grid, with numbers ranging from 13 to 46 (13 included in the range but 46 is not included). The numbers in each row and column must be strictly increasing or decreasing. This means that either first > second > third or first < second < third in each row and column. If a grid cell is marked with an 'x', the number in that position is hidden. The objective is to replace the 'x's with unique integers from the given range, ensuring that each number only appears once in the grid. The replacements must maintain the consecutive order in each row and column. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner should be minimized. The solution should be given as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should represent the replacement of a number with an  'x' number and contain three elements: the row index of the 'x', the column index  of the 'x' (both starting from 0), and the value of the number that replaces the 'x'. The initial state of the grid is as follows: \n\nGrid:\n [['16' 'x' '41']\n ['x' '30' 'x']\n ['x' '29' '30']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['16', '', '41'], ['', '30', ''], ['', '29', '30']]", 13, 46], 'is_correct': ["[['16', '', '41'], ['', '30', ''], ['', '29', '30']]", 13, 46], 'Astar': ["[['16', '', '41'], ['', '30', ''], ['', '29', '30']]", '13', '46'], 'opt': [[[0, 1, 31], [1, 0, 14], [1, 2, 32], [2, 0, 13]], 267, 0.23554539680480957]}
