{'difficulty': 9, 'statement': "We have a 3x3 numerical grid, with numbers ranging from 25 to 58 (25 included in the range but 58 is not included). The numbers in each row and column must be strictly increasing or decreasing. This means that either first > second > third or first < second < third in each row and column. If a grid cell is marked with an 'x', the number in that position is hidden. The objective is to replace the 'x's with unique integers from the given range, ensuring that each number only appears once in the grid. The replacements must maintain the consecutive order in each row and column. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner should be minimized. The solution should be given as a list of tuples in Python syntax.

The above code is an implementation of the A* search algorithm for the given problem. The `initialize` function initializes the visited_costs dictionary and the priority queue and encodes all of the information about the initial state and other variables given in the problem (ie the initial state of the grid, the dimensions of the grid, etc). The `a_star` function implements the A* algorithm, while the `heuristic` function calculates the heuristic cost of each state. The `is_increasing_or_decreasing` and `is_valid` functions are used to check if a state is a goal state and if a new state is valid, respectively. The solution is reported as a list of tuples in Python syntax.

This solution uses the A* search algorithm to find the minimum sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the numbers in the rightmost column, and the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner, with the constraint that the numbers in the grid are unique and each row and column is strictly increasing or decreasing. The heuristic function is the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the numbers in the rightmost column, and the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The is_goal_state function checks if the current state is the goal state, and the is_increasing and is_decreasing functions check if a list of numbers is strictly increasing or decreasing.

{'difficulty': 11, 'statement': "We have a 4x4 numerical grid, with numbers ranging from 36 to 76 (36 included in the range but 76 is not included). The numbers in each row and column must be strictly increasing or decreasing. This means that either first > second > third > fourth or first < second < third < fourth in each row and column. If a grid cell is marked with an 'x', the number in that position is hidden. The objective is to replace the 'x's with unique integers from the given range, ensuring that each number only appears once in the grid. The replacements must maintain the consecutive order in each row and column. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner should be minimized. The solution should be given as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should represent the replacement of a number with an  'x' number and contain three elements: the row index of the 'x', the column index  of the 'x' (both starting from 0), and the value of the number that replaces the 'x'.
