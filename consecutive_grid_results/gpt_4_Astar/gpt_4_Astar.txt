This code will return a list of tuples, each representing the replacement of an 'x' with a number. The tuples contain the row index, the column index, and the value of the number that replaces the 'x'. The code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state, where all 'x's are replaced with unique numbers from the given range, and the sum of the numbers in the topmost row, the rightmost column, and the main diagonal is minimized. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal by summing the minimum available number for each 'x' in the state. The code checks the validity of each new state by ensuring that the numbers in each row and column are strictly increasing or decreasing.

ID: 96
{'difficulty': 12, 'statement': "We have a 4x4 numerical grid, with numbers ranging from 22 to 82. The numbers in each row and column must be strictly increasing or decreasing. This means that either first > second > third > fourth or first < second < third < fourth in each row and column. If a grid cell is marked with an 'x', the number in that position is hidden. The objective is to replace the 'x's with unique integers from the given range, ensuring that each number only appears once in the grid. The replacements must maintain the consecutive order in each row and column. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the topmost row plus the numbers in the rightmost column plus the numbers in the diagonal connecting the top-left corner of the grid to its bottom-right corner should be minimized. The solution should be given as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should represent the replacement of a number with an  'x' number and contain three elements: the row index of the 'x', the column index  of the 'x' (both starting from 0), and the value of the number that replaces the 'x'. The initial state of the grid is as follows: \n\nGrid:\n [['x' '58' 'x' '77']\n ['x' '49' '63' '70']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' '69']\n ['22' '43' 'x' '68']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['', '58', '', '77'], ['', '49', '63', '70'], ['', '', '', '69'], ['22', '43', '', '68']]", 22, 82], 'is_correct': ["[['', '58', '', '77'], ['', '49', '63', '70'], ['', '', '', '69'], ['22', '43', '', '68']]", 22, 82], 'Astar': ["[['', '58', '', '77'], ['', '49', '63', '70'], ['', '', '', '69'], ['22', '43', '', '68']]", '22', '82'], 'opt': [[[0, 0, 25], [0, 2, 64], [1, 0, 24], [2, 0, 23], [2, 1, 44], [2, 2, 46], [3, 2, 45]], 696, 19.466492891311646]}
