This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (8, 0)
end = (2, 7)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and diagonal_jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 9 and 0 <= ny < 9 and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            if new_diagonal_jumps <= 3:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
                grid[nx][ny] = 1  # Mark as visited
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a BFS, starting from the start point. For each point, it checks all possible moves, and if the move leads to a valid point that has not been visited yet, it adds the new point to the queue. It also keeps track of the path taken to reach each point. If it reaches the end point and has made exactly 3 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and breaks the loop.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def dfs(pos, jumps, path):
    if jumps == 3 and pos == (8, 0):
        return path
    if jumps > 3 or pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > 8 or pos[1] < 0 or pos[1] > 8 or park[pos[0]][pos[1]] == 1:
        return None
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + dx, pos[1] + dy)
        result = dfs(new_pos, jumps + 1, path + [new_pos])
        if result is not None:
            return result
    return None

park = [
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

print(dfs((0, 4), 0, [(0, 4)]))
```

This script defines a recursive function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search on the trampoline park. It starts at the given position `pos`, with a given number of jumps `jumps` and a given path `path`. It checks if the current position is the destination and if the number of jumps is exactly 3. If so, it returns the current path. If the number of jumps is more than 3, or if the current position is outside the park, or if the current trampoline is broken, it returns `None`. Then it tries to jump to each of the four diagonal directions. If it finds a valid path, it returns it. If it doesn't find a valid path after trying all directions, it returns `None`. The script then defines the trampoline park as a list of lists of integers, and prints the shortest sequence of trampolines to jump on to reach the destination.

```

This script first defines the map of the trampoline park and the initial and final positions. It then defines a recursive function to perform the DFS. This function tries each possible move from the current position. If a move leads to a valid path (i.e., a path that makes exactly 3 jumps and reaches the end), it returns this path. If no valid path is found, it returns None. Finally, the script performs the DFS from the start position and prints the resulting path.

It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(grid, start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 9 and 0 <= ny < 9 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                new_jumps = jumps + (dx != 0 and dy != 0)
                if new_jumps > 3:
                    continue
                new_path = path + [(nx, ny)]
                if (nx, ny) == end and new_jumps == 3:
                    return new_path
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_jumps, new_path))
    return None

grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]

start = (8, 1)
end = (0, 5)
print(bfs(grid, start, end))
```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the number of jumps made (0), and the path taken (just the starting point). It also initializes a set of visited points with the starting point.

Then, it enters a loop where it pops a point, the number of jumps made to reach that point, and the path taken from the queue. It checks all eight possible directions from that point. If a direction leads to a valid, unvisited point, it increments the number of jumps if the move is diagonal, and continues to the next direction if this results in more than 3 jumps. If the new point is the destination and the number of jumps is 3, it returns the path taken. Otherwise, it adds the new point to the set of visited points and the queue.

Finally, if the queue is exhausted without finding a valid path, it returns None.

```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the number of jumps made so far (0), and the path taken so far (just the starting point). It also initializes a set of visited points with the starting point.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps taking points from the queue until it's empty. For each point, it tries to jump to all four diagonal directions. If the new point is within the grid, not broken, and not visited before, it adds it to the queue with the updated number of jumps and path. If it has made exactly 3 jumps and reached the end point, it returns the path.

If the queue becomes empty and it hasn't returned, it means there's no valid path, so it returns None.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (0, 8) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (8, 3).

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]

print(dfs((0, 8), 3, [(0, 8)]))
```

This script first defines the DFS function, which takes the current position, the number of remaining jumps, and the current path as arguments. It then checks if the current position is valid (i.e., within the grid and not on a broken trampoline) and if the number of remaining jumps is correct. If these conditions are met, it explores all possible directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) and recursively calls the DFS function for the new position. If it finds a valid path to the destination, it returns this path. If no valid path is found, it returns None.

The script then defines the trampoline park as a 2D list and calls the DFS function with the starting position, the number of jumps, and the initial path. The result is printed out.

```

This script first defines a DFS function that takes the current position, the number of jumps made, and the path taken as arguments. It then checks if the number of jumps is 3. If it is, it checks if the current position is the destination. If it is, it returns the path taken. If it's not, it returns None.

If the number of jumps is not 3, it iterates over all possible diagonal directions. For each direction, it calculates the new position and checks if it's within the park and if the trampoline at that position is not broken. If it is, it recursively calls the DFS function with the new position, the number of jumps increased by 1, and the path updated with the new position. If the recursive call returns a path, it returns that path. If it doesn't, it continues with the next direction.

If none of the directions lead to a path, it returns None.

Finally, it defines the park as a 2D list, where 1 represents a broken trampoline and 0 represents a functional one, and calls the DFS function with the initial position, 0 jumps, and the initial path containing only the initial position. It then prints the returned path.

In this case, we start from the position (8, 8) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the visited nodes to avoid cycles and also keep track of the path we have taken. If we reach the destination, we store the path. After exploring all possible paths, we return the shortest one.

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

print(dfs((8, 8), trampolines, set(), [], 3))
```

This script first defines a DFS function that takes the current position, the trampoline map, the set of visited positions, the current path, and the remaining number of jumps as arguments. It then checks if the current position is valid (i.e., within the grid, not a broken trampoline, and not visited before). If the current position is the destination and no more jumps are left, it returns the current path. Otherwise, it marks the current position as visited and recursively calls the DFS function for all four diagonal directions. If a valid path is found, it checks if it is shorter than the current shortest path and updates it if necessary. Finally, it unmarks the current position as visited and returns the shortest path.

The script then defines the trampoline map and calls the DFS function with the initial position, the trampoline map, an empty set of visited positions, an empty path, and 3 jumps. It prints the shortest path found.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

    queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the number of jumps made (0), and the path taken (just the starting point). It also initializes a set of visited points with the starting point.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps taking points from the queue until it's empty. For each point, it checks if it's the destination and if the number of jumps made is 3. If so, it returns the path taken.

Otherwise, it generates all possible next points by moving in all eight directions. If a next point is within the grid, not broken, and not visited before, it adds it to the visited set and the queue. It also increments the number of jumps if the move was diagonal, and only adds the point to the queue if the number of jumps is not more than 3.

Finally, if the queue becomes empty and no path was found, it returns None.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each node.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

    seen = set([start])

                queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops a node and its path from the queue, and for each of its neighbors, if the neighbor is within the grid, not broken, and not already seen, it adds the neighbor and the updated path to the queue and marks the neighbor as seen. If the neighbor is the end point, it returns the path.

It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we can only make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],

# Define the start and end points
start = (1, 0)
end = (5, 8)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue with the start point
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break
    if jumps < 3:
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 9 and 0 <= ny < 9 and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts by initializing a queue with the start point. It then enters a loop where it pops the first element from the queue, checks if it is the end point and if the number of jumps is 3. If it is, it prints the path and breaks the loop. If it is not, it adds all possible next points to the queue, along with the updated number of jumps and the updated path. This process continues until the end point is found or the queue is empty.

The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (0, 7) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (7, 0).

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
def dfs(pos, park, path, jumps):
    x, y = pos
    if not (0 <= x < 9 and 0 <= y < 9) or park[x][y] == 1:
        return None
    if jumps < 0:
        return None
    if pos == (7, 0) and jumps == 0:
        return path + [pos]
    park[x][y] = 1
    shortest = None
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]:
        result = dfs((x + dx, y + dy), park, path + [pos], jumps - 1)
        if result is not None and (shortest is None or len(result) < len(shortest)):
            shortest = result
    park[x][y] = 0
    return shortest

park = [
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
]

print(dfs((0, 7), park, [], 3))
```

This script first defines a DFS function that takes the current position, the park map, the current path, and the remaining number of jumps as arguments. It checks if the current position is valid and if it has reached the destination with exactly 3 jumps. If so, it returns the current path. Otherwise, it marks the current position as visited and recursively explores all four diagonal directions. It keeps track of the shortest valid path and returns it. Finally, it unmarks the current position before returning to allow other paths to visit it.

The script then defines the park map and calls the DFS function with the initial position, the park map, an empty path, and 3 jumps. It prints the shortest path found.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(grid, start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
            return path
        for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 9 and 0 <= ny < 9 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                new_jumps = jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else jumps
                if new_jumps <= 3:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), new_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
    return None

grid = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]
start = (0, 7)
end = (7, 1)
print(bfs(grid, start, end))
```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the number of jumps made (0), and the path taken (just the starting point). It also initializes a set of visited points with the starting point.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps taking points from the queue until it's empty. For each point, it checks if it's the destination and if the number of jumps made is 3. If so, it returns the path taken.

Otherwise, it generates all possible next points by moving in all eight directions. If a next point is within the grid, not broken, and not visited before, it adds it to the visited set and the queue. It also increments the number of jumps if the move was diagonal, and only adds the point to the queue if the number of jumps is not more than 3.

Finally, if the queue becomes empty and no path was found, it returns None.

```

This script starts by defining the map of the trampoline park and the starting and ending positions. It then initializes a queue with the starting position, and enters a loop where it pops the next position from the queue. If this position is the ending position and we've made exactly 3 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it adds all possible next positions to the queue, taking care to only add positions that are within the bounds of the park, are not broken, and do not result in more than 3 diagonal jumps.

```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start point, end point, and grid as input. The function uses a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to get there. It then iterates over all possible moves, checking if the move is valid (i.e., within the grid and not onto a broken trampoline). If the move is valid, it adds the new position and the updated path to the queue. If it reaches the end point with exactly 3 moves, it returns the path. If no valid path is found, it returns None. Finally, it prints the shortest path.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the map of the trampoline park
park = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (8, 2)
end = (1, 8)

# Define the possible moves (diagonal only)
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Initialize the queue for the BFS
queue = deque([(start, [start])])

while queue:
    # Get the current position and path
    (x, y), path = queue.popleft()

    # Check if we have reached the end
    if (x, y) == end and len(path) == 4:
        print(path)
        break

    # Check all possible moves
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # Check if the new position is valid
        if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and park[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting position and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it dequeues the first element in the queue, checks if it is the end position, and if not, enqueues all valid moves from the current position. A move is valid if it is within the bounds of the park, the trampoline is not broken, and it has not been visited before. The script continues this process until it finds a path to the end position.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (1, 9)
end = (5, 0)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue with the start point
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Pop the next point from the queue
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If this is the end point, return the path
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break

    # If we've made too many jumps, continue
    if jumps > 3:
        continue

    # Add all possible next moves to the queue
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts at the start point and explores all possible moves from there, adding them to a queue. It then pops the next point from the queue and repeats the process. If it reaches the end point with exactly 3 jumps, it prints the path and breaks the loop. If it reaches the end point with more than 3 jumps, it discards that path and continues with the next one in the queue.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list in Python, and use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Trampoline park map
park = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],

    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Starting and destination positions
start = (1, 9)
end = (8, 3)

# Directions for diagonal jumps
directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break
    if (x, y) not in visited or visited[(x, y)] > jumps:
        visited[(x, y)] = jumps
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting position, the number of jumps made so far (0), and the path taken so far (just the starting position). It also initializes a set to keep track of the visited positions.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps taking nodes from the queue until it's empty. For each node, it checks if it's the destination and if the number of jumps made so far is 3. If so, it prints the path and breaks the loop.

If not, it checks if the current position has been visited before, and if the number of jumps made so far is less than the number of jumps made when this position was visited before. If so, it updates the number of jumps for this position in the visited set.

Then, it calculates the new positions for each possible diagonal jump, and if the new position is within the park and the trampoline there is not broken, it adds the new position, the updated number of jumps, and the updated path to the queue.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (9, 9) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (4, 1).

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the map of the park
park_map = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
]

# Define the start and end positions
start = (9, 9)
end = (4, 1)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Define a function to check if a position is valid
def is_valid(pos):
    x, y = pos
    return 0 <= x < 10 and 0 <= y < 10 and park_map[x][y] == 0

# Define a function to find the shortest path
def find_path(pos, end, path, jumps):
    if jumps < 0 or not is_valid(pos):
        return None
    path = path + [pos]
    if pos == end:
        return path if jumps == 0 else None
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])
        new_path = find_path(new_pos, end, path, jumps - 1)
        if new_path is not None:
            return new_path
    return None

# Find the shortest path
path = find_path(start, end, [], 3)
print(path)
```

This script first defines the map of the park, the start and end positions, and the possible moves. It then defines a function to check if a position is valid (i.e., within the park and not on a broken trampoline). The main part of the script is the `find_path` function, which uses a recursive DFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. Finally, it finds and prints the shortest path.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the map of the trampoline park
park = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (0, 0)
end = (7, 6)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue for the BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Pop the next position from the queue
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If this is the end position, return the path
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break

    # If we have not made 3 jumps yet, try jumping to a new position
    if jumps < 3:
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts by initializing a queue with the starting position, the number of jumps made so far (0), and the path taken so far (just the starting position). It then enters a loop where it keeps popping positions from the queue until it finds the end position with exactly 3 jumps. For each position, it tries jumping to all possible new positions, and if a jump is possible, it adds the new position to the queue with the updated number of jumps and path. When it finds the end position with exactly 3 jumps, it prints the path and breaks the loop.

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. Note that this script assumes that a path exists. If there is no path, the script will run indefinitely. To prevent this, you could add a maximum number of iterations or a timeout.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (7, 9)
end = (3, 0)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Initialize the queue for the BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Get the current position, number of diagonal jumps, and path
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If we have reached the end, print the path and stop
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break

    # Try all possible moves
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # Check if the new position is valid
        if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            # Check if the move is diagonal
            if dx != 0 and dy != 0:
                # If we have already made 3 diagonal jumps, skip this move
                if jumps == 3:
                    continue
                else:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
            else:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, the script will not print anything.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (8, 0) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (0, 6).

```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the distance from the start (0), the number of jumps made (0), and the path taken (just the start). It also initializes a set of visited nodes with the starting point.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps taking nodes from the queue until it's empty. For each node, it checks if it's the end point and if the number of jumps is 3. If it is, it returns the path.

If it's not the end point or the number of jumps is not 3, it generates all possible next nodes by moving diagonally, checks if they are within the grid and not broken, and if they haven't been visited yet. If all checks pass, it adds the new node to the queue and the visited set.

If the queue becomes empty and no path has been found, it returns None.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We will keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step, and only consider paths that have made exactly 3 diagonal jumps when we reach the destination.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the map of the trampoline park
park = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (0, 9)
end = (7, 3)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Initialize the queue for the BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Get the current position, number of diagonal jumps, and path
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If we have reached the destination with exactly 3 diagonal jumps, print the path and exit
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break

    # Try all possible moves
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # Check if the new position is valid
        if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            # Count the diagonal jumps
            new_jumps = jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else jumps

            # If we have not made more than 3 diagonal jumps, add the new position to the queue
            if new_jumps <= 3:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, the script will not print anything.

```

This script starts at the starting position and tries all possible moves. If a move leads to a valid position (i.e., a trampoline that is not broken and within the park), it adds the new position to the queue. It also keeps track of the number of jumps made and the path taken. If it reaches the end position with exactly 3 jumps, it prints the path and stops. If it has made too many jumps, it discards the current path and continues with the next one in the queue.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we can only make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (10, 10)
end = (0, 4)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Define the BFS function
def bfs(start, end, grid):
    queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (x, y), d, path = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == end and d == 3:
            return path
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), d + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
                visited.add((nx, ny))
    return None

# Print the shortest path
print(bfs(start, end, grid))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start and end points and the grid as input, and returns the shortest path from the start to the end point. The function uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next, and a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. It then iterates over the queue, visiting each node and its neighbors in turn, until it finds the end point. If it finds the end point, it returns the path to it. If it doesn't find the end point, it returns None. Finally, the script prints the shortest path.

This script starts by initializing a queue with the starting position, an empty path, and 0 jumps. It then enters a loop where it pops the first element from the queue, checks if it's the destination with 3 jumps, and if not, adds all valid neighboring positions to the queue. The script keeps track of visited positions to avoid visiting the same position multiple times. The loop continues until it finds a path to the destination with exactly 3 jumps, at which point it prints the path and breaks the loop.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],

]

# Define the start and end points

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Define the BFS function
def bfs(start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        (x, y), path = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if (0 <= nx < 11 and 0 <= ny < 11 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and
                (nx, ny) not in seen):
                if len(path) < 4:
                    queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))
                    seen.add((nx, ny))
                elif (nx, ny) == end:
                    return path + [(nx, ny)]
    return None

# Print the shortest sequence of trampolines
print(bfs(start, end))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start and end points as arguments. The function uses a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to get there. It then iterates over the possible moves, checking if each move is valid (i.e., within the grid and not onto a broken trampoline). If the move is valid and the path length is less than 4, it adds the new position and path to the queue. If the move is valid and the path length is 4, it checks if the new position is the end point. If it is, it returns the path. If no valid path is found, it returns None. Finally, it prints the shortest sequence of trampolines.

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination. Note that this script assumes that it is possible to reach the destination. If it is not possible, the script will run indefinitely. To prevent this, you could add a limit to the number of iterations, or keep track of the nodes that have been visited and stop when all nodes have been visited.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the trampoline park
park = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (9, 9)
end = (0, 3)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break
    if (x, y) in visited or jumps > 3:
        continue
    visited.add((x, y))
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 11 and 0 <= ny < 11 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts at the starting position and explores all possible moves, keeping track of the number of jumps made and the path taken. It stops when it reaches the destination with exactly 3 jumps. The result is printed as a list of tuples, each representing a trampoline that Alex jumps on.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (9, 9) and explore all possible paths with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (2, 0).

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the grid

# Define the start and end positions
start = (9, 9)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Define a recursive function to perform the DFS
def dfs(pos, jumps, path):
    # If we have made 3 jumps and reached the end, return the path
    if jumps == 3 and pos == end:
        return path

    # If we have made 3 jumps but not reached the end, return None
    if jumps == 3:
        return None

    # Try all possible moves
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])

        # If the new position is valid, continue the DFS
        if 0 <= new_pos[0] < 11 and 0 <= new_pos[1] < 11 and grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == 0:
            result = dfs(new_pos, jumps + 1, path + [new_pos])

            # If the DFS found a valid path, return it
            if result is not None:
                return result

    # If no valid path was found, return None
    return None

# Perform the DFS and print the result
print(dfs(start, 0, [start]))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end positions, and the possible moves. It then defines a recursive function to perform the DFS. This function tries all possible moves from the current position, and if a move leads to a valid path, it returns that path. If no valid path is found, it returns None. Finally, the script performs the DFS and prints the result.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, and use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Trampoline park map
park = [
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],

    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
]

# Starting and destination positions
start = (10, 0)
end = (2, 7)

# BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 11 and 0 <= ny < 11 and park[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
            visited.add((nx, ny))
            new_jumps = jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else jumps
            if new_jumps <= 3:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If there is no such sequence, it will not print anything.

```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point, the number of jumps made so far (0), and the path taken so far (an empty list). It also initializes a set to keep track of visited positions.

Then, it enters a loop where it keeps processing positions from the queue until it's empty. For each position, it checks if it's the destination and if the number of jumps made so far is 3. If so, it returns the path taken so far, including the current position.

If the current position has been visited before or if more than 3 jumps have been made, it skips the current position and continues with the next one.

Otherwise, it marks the current position as visited and adds all its diagonal neighbors to the queue, along with the updated number of jumps and path.

If the queue becomes empty and no valid path has been found, it returns None.

The script then defines the trampoline park, the starting point, and the destination, and calls the bfs function with these parameters. It prints the result, which is the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination.

print(bfs(start, end))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start and end points as arguments. The function uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. It starts by adding the start node to the queue. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it removes the next node from the queue, checks if it is the end node and if the number of jumps is 3, and if so, returns the path. If not, it adds all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue. Finally, it prints the shortest path from the start to the end.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list in Python, and use a queue to keep track of the nodes we need to visit.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the trampoline park
park = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],

    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (2, 1)
end = (10, 9)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue with the starting position
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Pop the next position from the queue
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If this is the end position, print the path and break
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 3:
        print(path)
        break

    # If we have made 3 jumps, continue without adding neighbors
    if jumps == 3:
        continue

    # Add the neighbors to the queue
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 11 and 0 <= ny < 11 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, it will not print anything.

This script first defines the trampoline park map as a 2D list. It then defines a BFS function, which takes a start point and an end point as arguments. The function uses a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to get there. It then iterates over all possible diagonal moves, checks if the move is valid (i.e., within the park boundaries and not on a broken trampoline), and if the move leads to the end point with exactly 3 jumps, it returns the path. If not, it adds the new position and the updated path to the queue. Finally, the script defines the start and end points and calls the BFS function to find the shortest path.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional trampolines.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the trampoline park
park = [
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],

    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (11, 9)
end = (0, 3)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), count, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and count == 4:
        print(path)
        break
    if (x, y) not in visited or visited[(x, y)] > count:
        visited[(x, y)] = count
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 12 and 0 <= ny < 12 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), count + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts at the starting position and explores all possible moves, keeping track of the number of moves made and the path taken. It continues exploring until it finds a path to the destination that includes exactly 4 diagonal jumps. The path is then printed out.

It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start from the position (6, 11) and explore all possible paths with exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (0, 0).

Here is the Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],

    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]

# Define the start and end positions
start = (6, 11)
end = (0, 0)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Define a recursive function to perform the DFS
def dfs(pos, grid, path, jumps):
    # If we have made 4 jumps and reached the end, return the path
    if pos == end and jumps == 4:
        return path

    # If we have made 4 jumps and not reached the end, return None
    if jumps == 4:
        return None

    # Try each possible move
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])

        # If the new position is valid, continue the DFS
        if 0 <= new_pos[0] < 12 and 0 <= new_pos[1] < 12 and grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == 0:
            result = dfs(new_pos, grid, path + [new_pos], jumps + 1)

            # If the DFS found a valid path, return it
            if result is not None:
                return result

    # If no valid path was found, return None
    return None

# Perform the DFS and print the result
result = dfs(start, grid, [start], 0)
print(result)
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end positions, and the possible moves. It then defines a recursive function to perform the DFS. This function tries each possible move from the current position, and if the new position is valid, it continues the DFS from there. If it has made 4 jumps and reached the end, it returns the path. If it has made 4 jumps and not reached the end, or if it has tried all possible moves and not found a valid path, it returns None. Finally, it performs the DFS and prints the result.

TypeError: 'set' object does not support item assignment

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, and use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Trampoline park map
park = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
]

# Starting and destination positions
start = (1, 11)
end = (11, 3)

# Directions for diagonal jumps
directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 4:
        print(path)
        break
    if (x, y) not in visited or visited[(x, y)] > jumps:
        visited[(x, y)] = jumps
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 12 and 0 <= ny < 12 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), jumps + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If there is no such sequence, it will not print anything.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional trampolines.

# Initialize the queue for the BFS
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Pop the next node from the queue
    node, jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If we have reached the end, print the path and exit
    if node == end and jumps == 4:

        break

    # If we have made too many jumps, skip this node

                park[next_node[0]][next_node[1]] == 0):
            queue.append((next_node, jumps + 1, path + [next_node]))
```

This script starts at the starting position and explores all possible paths, keeping track of the number of jumps made and the path taken. When it finds a path that reaches the end with exactly 4 jumps, it prints the path and exits. If it encounters a node that has made too many jumps, it skips that node.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (2, 11)
end = (8, 1)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and diagonal_jumps == 4:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 12 and 0 <= ny < 12 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
            visited.add((nx, ny))
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it considers all possible moves, and adds the resulting points to the queue if they are within the grid, not broken, and have not been visited before. It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made. If it finds a path to the end point that involves exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step, and only consider paths that have made exactly 4 diagonal jumps when we reach the destination.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

    for move in moves:

        next_diagonals = diagonals + 1 if abs(move[0]) == abs(move[1]) else diagonals
        if (0 <= next_point[0] < 12 and 0 <= next_point[1] < 12 and
            grid[next_point[0]][next_point[1]] == 0 and
            next_diagonals <= 4):
            queue.append((next_point, next_diagonals, path + [next_point]))
```

This script starts by defining the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it considers all possible moves, and adds the resulting points to the queue if they are within the grid, not broken, and have not been visited before. It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made. If it finds a path to the end point that involves exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we can only make 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (11, 2)
end = (3, 10)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Define the BFS function
def bfs(start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (x, y), step, path = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == end and step == 4:
            return path
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 12 and 0 <= ny < 12 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), step + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
                visited.add((nx, ny))
    return None

# Print the shortest path
print(bfs(start, end))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that uses a queue to keep track of the current position, the number of steps taken, and the path taken so far. It iterates over the queue, checking each position. If it reaches the end point after exactly 4 steps, it returns the path. Otherwise, it adds all possible next positions to the queue and continues the search. If no path is found, it returns None. Finally, it calls the BFS function and prints the shortest path.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made. If the number of diagonal jumps is not exactly 4, we will discard that path.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (1, 0)
end = (11, 7)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Initialize the queue with the start point
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and diagonal_jumps == 4:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 12 and 0 <= ny < 12 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, it will not print anything.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we can only make exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

                    visited.add((nx, ny))
    return None

# Print the shortest path
print(bfs(start, end, grid))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start and end points and the grid as input, and returns the shortest path from the start to the end. The function uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next, and a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. It then iterates over the queue, visiting each node and its neighbors in turn, until it finds the end point or the queue is empty. If it finds the end point, it returns the path to it. If the queue is empty, it returns None, indicating that there is no path to the end point.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each node, so that we can return the shortest path at the end.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

        break

    # For each possible move
    for dx, dy in moves:
        # Calculate the new position
        x, y = node[0] + dx, node[1] + dy

        # If the new position is valid
        if 0 <= x < 13 and 0 <= y < 13 and grid[x][y] == 0 and (x, y) not in path:
            # Add the new position to the queue
            queue.append(((x, y), path + [(x, y)], jumps + 1))

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start from the position (0, 7) and explore all possible paths with exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (12, 1). 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the grid
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],

# Define the start and end positions
start = (0, 7)
end = (12, 1)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Initialize the shortest path
shortest_path = None

# Define the DFS function
def dfs(pos, path, jumps):
    global shortest_path
    # If we have made 4 jumps and reached the end, update the shortest path
    if jumps == 4 and pos == end:
        if shortest_path is None or len(path) < len(shortest_path):
            shortest_path = path
        return
    # If we have made 4 jumps but not reached the end, return
    if jumps == 4:
        return
    # Try all possible moves
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])
        # If the new position is valid and not broken, continue the DFS
        if 0 <= new_pos[0] < 13 and 0 <= new_pos[1] < 13 and grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == 0:
            dfs(new_pos, path + [new_pos], jumps + 1)

# Start the DFS
dfs(start, [start], 0)

# Print the shortest path
print(shortest_path)
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end positions, and the possible moves. It then initializes the shortest path to None. The dfs function is defined to perform a depth-first search. It takes the current position, the current path, and the number of jumps made as arguments. If the current position is the end and we have made exactly 4 jumps, it updates the shortest path. If we have made 4 jumps but not reached the end, it returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it tries all possible moves and continues the DFS for each valid move. Finally, it starts the DFS from the start position and prints the shortest path.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

# Define the possible moves

# Initialize the queue with the start point

while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()

        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 13 and 0 <= ny < 13 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            if new_diagonal_jumps <= 4:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts by initializing a queue with the start point, and then enters a loop where it pops a point from the queue, checks if it is the end point and if the number of diagonal jumps is 4, and if not, adds all valid adjacent points to the queue. The loop continues until it finds a valid path or the queue is empty.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (11, 5) and explore all possible paths with exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (0, 12).

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

    if jumps < 0:
        return None

    # Try each possible move
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])

        # If the new position is valid, continue the search from there
        if (0 <= new_pos[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= new_pos[1] < len(grid[0]) and
                grid[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == 0):
            result = dfs(new_pos, end, grid, path + [new_pos], jumps - 1)

            # If the search was successful, return the result
            if result is not None:
                return result

    # If no moves were successful, return None
    return None

# Perform the search and print the result
result = dfs(start, end, grid, [start], 4)
print(result)
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end positions, and the possible moves. It then defines a recursive function to perform the DFS. This function tries each possible move from the current position, and if the new position is valid, it continues the search from there. If it reaches the end position with exactly 4 jumps, it returns the path taken. If no moves are successful, it returns None. Finally, it performs the search and prints the result.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

# Define the grid

# Define the possible moves

# Initialize the queue with the start point

while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()

        break

        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 13 and 0 <= ny < 13 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            if new_diagonal_jumps <= 4:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts by initializing a queue with the start point, and then enters a loop where it repeatedly dequeues a point and its associated path. If this point is the end point and the number of diagonal jumps is 4, it prints the path and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it enqueues all valid adjacent points that have not been visited yet, along with the updated number of diagonal jumps and the updated path.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the trampoline park

    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],

# Define the start and end positions
start = (1, 8)
end = (10, 0)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Define a function to check if a position is valid
def is_valid(pos):
    x, y = pos
    return 0 <= x < 13 and 0 <= y < 13 and park[x][y] == 0

# Define a function to find the path
def find_path(pos, end, path, jumps):
    if jumps > 4 or not is_valid(pos):
        return None
    path.append(pos)
    if pos == end and jumps == 4:
        return path
    for move in moves:
        new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])
        result = find_path(new_pos, end, path, jumps + 1)
        if result:
            return result
    path.pop()
    return None

# Find the path
path = find_path(start, end, [], 0)
print(path)
```

This script first defines the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones. It then defines the start and end positions, and the possible moves Alex can make (diagonal jumps in all four directions). 

The `is_valid` function checks if a position is within the bounds of the park and if the trampoline at that position is functional. 

The `find_path` function is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search to find a path from the start position to the end position. It keeps track of the current position, the end position, the current path, and the number of jumps made. If the current position is the end position and the number of jumps is 4, it returns the path. Otherwise, it tries to move in each of the four possible directions. If a move leads to a valid position, it recursively calls itself with the new position. If a move does not lead to a valid position or a path to the end position, it backtracks by removing the last position from the path. 

Finally, it calls the `find_path` function with the start position, end position, an empty path, and 0 jumps, and prints the resulting path.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each node, so that we can return the shortest path at the end.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

                queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

print(shortest_path(grid, start, end))
```

This script first initializes a queue with the starting point and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it dequeues a point and its path, and for each of its neighbors, if the neighbor is within the grid, not broken, and not already seen, it enqueues the neighbor and the path to it. If the neighbor is the end point, it returns the path to it.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the initial position (1, 12) and explore all possible paths with exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (8, 2).

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list in Python, and use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the trampoline park

    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],

    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (11, 3)
end = (1, 10)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue with the starting position
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    # Pop the next node from the queue
    (x, y), count, path = queue.popleft()

    # If we have reached the end, print the path and break
    if (x, y) == end and count == 4:
        print(path)
        break

    # If we have made 4 jumps but have not reached the end, continue
    if count == 4:
        continue

    # Add the reachable nodes to the queue
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 13 and 0 <= ny < 13 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), count + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, it will not print anything.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step, and only consider paths that have made exactly 4 diagonal jumps when we reach the destination.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the trampoline park

    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],

]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (2, 12)
end = (10, 1)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, [start], 0)])
while queue:
    (x, y), path, diagonals = queue.popleft()
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 14 and 0 <= ny < 14 and park[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            new_diagonals = diagonals + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonals
            if new_diagonals <= 4:
                new_path = path + [(nx, ny)]
                if (nx, ny) == end and new_diagonals == 4:
                    print(new_path)
                    exit(0)
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_path, new_diagonals))
```

This script starts at the starting position and explores all possible moves from there, keeping track of the path taken and the number of diagonal jumps made. If it reaches the destination with exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and exits. If it explores all possible paths without finding a solution, it does nothing.

He is currently on the trampoline at position (10, 12) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (1, 1). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]', 4], 'is_correct': ['[[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]', [10, 12], [1, 1], 4], 'Astar': ['[[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]', '(10, 12)', '(1, 1)', '4'], 'opt': [[[10, 12], [9, 11], [8, 10], [7, 9], [6, 8], [5, 8], [4, 8], [4, 7], [4, 6], [4, 5], [4, 4], [3, 4], [3, 3], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1]], 17, 0.030817031860351562]}

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

# While there are positions to explore
while queue:

    (x, y), jumps, path = queue.popleft()

    # If we have reached the end and made exactly 4 diagonal jumps
    if (x, y) == end and jumps == 4:
        # Print the path and stop the search
        print(path)
        break

    # For each possible move
    for dx, dy in moves:
        # Calculate the new position
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # If the new position is inside the park and the trampoline is not broken
        if 0 <= nx < 14 and 0 <= ny < 14 and park[nx][ny] == 0:

                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, if such a sequence exists. If there is no such sequence, it will not print anything.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

        print((x, y))
        break

    # For each possible move
    for dx, dy in moves:
        # Calculate the new position
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # If the new position is within the park and the trampoline is not broken
        if 0 <= nx < 14 and 0 <= ny < 14 and park[nx][ny] == 0:
            # Calculate the number of diagonal jumps
            njumps = jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else jumps

                # Mark the trampoline as broken so we don't visit it again
                park[nx][ny] = 1

                print((nx, ny))
```

This script will print the sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. Note that the exact sequence may vary depending on the order in which the moves are defined.

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, keeping track of the number of diagonal jumps made. When it finds a path from the start to the end that involves exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made at each step, and only consider paths that have made 4 diagonal jumps when we reach the destination.

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it considers all possible moves, and adds the resulting points to the queue if they are within the grid, not broken, and have not been visited before. It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only considers paths that involve exactly 4 diagonal jumps. When it finds a path from the start to the end point that involves exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints this path and stops.

He is currently on the trampoline at position (9, 0) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (3, 13). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]', 4], 'is_correct': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]', [9, 0], [3, 13], 4], 'Astar': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]', '(9, 0)', '(3, 13)', '4'], 'opt': [[[9, 0], [8, 1], [7, 2], [6, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5], [5, 6], [4, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [3, 9], [4, 9], [4, 10], [4, 11], [4, 12], [4, 13], [3, 13]], 18, 0.028172016143798828]}

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

while queue:
    # Pop the next point from the queue
    (x, y), path, diag_count = queue.popleft()

    # If this point is the end point, print the path and exit
    if (x, y) == end and diag_count == 4:

        break

    # Add all possible next points to the queue
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if (0 <= nx < 14 and 0 <= ny < 14 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path):

            if new_diag_count <= 4:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)], new_diag_count))
```

This script starts at the start point and explores all possible paths, keeping track of the path taken and the number of diagonal jumps made. When it finds a path to the end point that includes exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and exits.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making sure to only make 4 diagonal jumps. We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each node, so that we can return the shortest path at the end.

    # If there is no path to the end position, return an empty list

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, while making sure to only make 4 diagonal jumps and avoiding broken trampolines.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

]

# Define the starting and ending positions
start = (0, 4)
end = (13, 12)

# Define the possible moves (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals)
moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue for the BFS algorithm
queue = deque([(start, [start])])

while queue:
    # Get the current position and path
    (x, y), path = queue.popleft()

    # Check if we have reached the end
    if (x, y) == end:
        print(path)
        break

    # Check all possible moves
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # Check if the new position is inside the park and the trampoline is not broken
        if 0 <= nx < 14 and 0 <= ny < 14 and park[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in path:
            # Add the new position to the queue
            queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))

This script will print the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. Note that the actual output will depend on the specific layout of the trampoline park.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

# Initialize the queue for the BFS

while queue:
    # Pop the next position from the queue
    pos, path, diagonals = queue.popleft()

    # If we've reached the end, print the path and exit
    if pos == end and diagonals == 4:
        print(path)
        break

    # Otherwise, add all possible next positions to the queue
    for move in moves:
        next_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])
        if (0 <= next_pos[0] < 14 and 0 <= next_pos[1] < 14 and
            park[next_pos[0]][next_pos[1]] == 0 and
            next_pos not in path):
            next_diagonals = diagonals + 1 if move in moves[:4] else diagonals
            if next_diagonals <= 4:
                queue.append((next_pos, path + [next_pos], next_diagonals))

This script starts at the starting position and explores all possible paths from there, keeping track of the number of diagonal jumps made. When it finds a path that ends at the destination and has exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and exits.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

This script first defines the grid and the starting and ending points. It then defines the possible moves that Alex can make. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the starting point. For each position, it checks all possible moves, and adds the new position to the queue if it is valid (i.e., within the grid, not a broken trampoline, and not already visited). It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made. If it finds a path to the ending point that involves exactly 4 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start from the initial position (14, 2) and explore all possible paths with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the visited nodes to avoid cycles and also keep track of the path we have taken. If we reach the destination, we store the path. After exploring all possible paths, we return the shortest one.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we will start from the position (14, 10) and try to reach the position (2, 1) by making exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We will use a recursive function to implement the DFS algorithm. The function will take the current position, the number of jumps left, and the path taken so far as arguments. It will check if the current position is the destination and if the number of jumps left is 0. If so, it will return the path taken so far. Otherwise, it will try to make a jump in each of the eight possible directions, and call itself recursively with the new position, the number of jumps left minus one, and the updated path.

Here is the Python script that implements this algorithm:

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that involve exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],

    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Define the start and end points
start = (13, 1)
end = (4, 13)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), diagonal_jumps, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and diagonal_jumps == 5:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 15 and 0 <= ny < 15 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
            visited.add((nx, ny))
            new_diagonal_jumps = diagonal_jumps + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else diagonal_jumps
            if new_diagonal_jumps <= 5:
                queue.append(((nx, ny), new_diagonal_jumps, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it considers all possible moves, and adds the resulting points to the queue if they are within the grid, not broken, and have not been visited before. It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only considers paths with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. When it finds a path from the start to the end point with exactly 5 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

start = (0, 13)
end = (13, 5)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

# Initialize the queue with the start point
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])

while queue:
    (x, y), d, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and d == 5:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 15 and 0 <= ny < 15 and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
            queue.append(((nx, ny), d + 1, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script starts by initializing a queue with the start point. It then enters a loop where it pops the first element from the queue, checks if it is the end point and if the number of diagonal jumps is 5. If it is, it prints the path and breaks the loop. If it is not, it adds all possible next points to the queue, along with the updated number of diagonal jumps and the updated path. This process continues until the end point is found or the queue is empty.

This script starts at the starting point and explores all possible moves from there, adding each new position to the queue along with the path taken to reach it. It continues this process until it finds a path to the ending point that includes exactly 5 diagonal jumps. The path is then printed out.

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it considers all possible moves, and adds the new point to the queue if it is within the grid, is not broken, and has not been visited before. It also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made. If it reaches the end point with exactly 5 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and stops.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we start at the position (11, 1) and explore all possible paths with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (2, 12). 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
# Define the grid
grid = [
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],

    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]

# Define the start and end positions
start = (11, 1)
end = (2, 12)

# Define the possible moves
moves = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]

# Initialize the stack with the start position
stack = [(start, [start])]

while stack:
    (vertex, path) = stack.pop()
    for next in (vertex[0] + move[0], vertex[1] + move[1]) for move in moves:
        if (0 <= next[0] < 15 and 0 <= next[1] < 15 and grid[next[0]][next[1]] == 0):
            if next == end and len(path) == 6:
                print(path + [next])
            else:
                stack.append((next, path + [next]))
```

This script uses a stack to keep track of the current path and the next vertices to explore. It iterates over all possible moves from the current vertex and adds the new vertex to the stack if it is valid (i.e., within the grid and not a broken trampoline). If the new vertex is the end position and the path length is 6 (5 jumps plus the start position), it prints the path.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, with the constraint that we must make exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We will represent the trampoline park as a 2D list, with 1s representing broken trampolines and 0s representing functional ones.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then defines a BFS function that takes the start and end points as arguments. The function uses a queue to keep track of the current position, the number of diagonal jumps made, and the path taken. It then iterates over the queue, checking if the current position is the end point and if the number of diagonal jumps is 5. If it is, it returns the path. Otherwise, it adds all valid adjacent positions to the queue and continues the search. If no valid path is found, it returns None. Finally, it calls the BFS function with the start and end points and prints the result.

This problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

In this case, we will start at the position (10, 1) and explore all possible paths with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We will keep track of the shortest path that leads to the destination (3, 14).

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this case, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. We will also keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made, and only consider paths that have exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

# Define the possible moves

# Perform a breadth-first search
queue = deque([(start, 0, [start])])
visited = set()
while queue:
    (x, y), d, path = queue.popleft()
    if (x, y) == end and d == 5:
        print(path)
        break
    for dx, dy in moves:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 15 and 0 <= ny < 15 and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
            visited.add((nx, ny))
            nd = d + 1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else d
            queue.append(((nx, ny), nd, path + [(nx, ny)]))
```

This script first defines the grid, the start and end points, and the possible moves. It then performs a breadth-first search, starting from the start point. For each point, it checks all possible moves, and adds the new point to the queue if it is within the grid, is not broken, and has not been visited before. It also increments the number of diagonal jumps if the move was diagonal. If it reaches the end point and has made exactly 5 diagonal jumps, it prints the path and breaks the loop.
