The above code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, including the first and final trampolines, as a list of tuples indicating the row and column of each trampoline. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state, with the cost of each state being the number of jumps made to reach that state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the shortest path from the current position to the goal position, assuming Alex can jump directly to the goal position. This heuristic is admissible as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state, and is consistent as the estimated cost of the successor node is always the same or higher than the current node, and the heuristic estimate for the goal state is 0.

ID: 4
{'difficulty': 9, 'statement': 'Alex is at a trampoline park with a grid of mini trampolines, arranged in a square of 9x9. Some trampolines are broken and unusable. A map of the park is provided below, with 1 indicating a broken trampoline and 0 indicating a functional one. Alex can jump to any of the eight adjacent trampolines, as long as they are not broken. However, Alex must make excatly 3 diagonal jumps, no more, no less, on his path to his destination. He is currently on the trampoline at position (8, 1) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (0, 5). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', 3], 'is_correct': ['[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', [8, 1], [0, 5], 3], 'Astar': ['[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', '(8, 1)', '(0, 5)', '3'], 'opt': [[[8, 1], [7, 1], [6, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4], [4, 5], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [2, 8], [1, 8], [1, 7], [1, 6], [0, 6], [0, 5]], 16, 0.026789426803588867]}
