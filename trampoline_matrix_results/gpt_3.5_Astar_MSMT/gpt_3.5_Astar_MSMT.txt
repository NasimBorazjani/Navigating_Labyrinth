{'difficulty': 9, 'statement': 'Alex is at a trampoline park with a grid of mini trampolines, arranged in a square of 9x9. Some trampolines are broken and unusable. A map of the park is provided below, with 1 indicating a broken trampoline and 0 indicating a functional one. Alex can jump to any of the eight adjacent trampolines, as long as they are not broken. However, Alex must make excatly 3 diagonal jumps, no more, no less, on his path to his destination. He is currently on the trampoline at position (8, 0) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (2, 7). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0', 'is_feasible': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]]', 3], 'is_correct': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]]', [8, 0], [2, 7], 3], 'Astar': ['[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]]', '(8, 0)', '(2, 7)', '3'], 'opt': [[[8, 0], [7, 1], [6, 1], [5, 1], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [2, 7]], 11, 0.03385114669799805]}
