This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination, including the first and final trampolines, as a list of tuples indicating the row and column of each trampoline. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path, with the Manhattan distance serving as the heuristic function. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and maintains a priority queue of states not yet visited. The priority of each state in the queue is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal. The algorithm continues until it finds a path to the goal state or until there are no more states to visit.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance from the current state to the goal state plus the absolute difference between the number of diagonal jumps made and the required number of diagonal jumps. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state, and it is consistent because the cost of moving to a neighboring state is always 1, which is exactly the decrease in the Manhattan distance if the state is moved toward the goal state.

The above code implements the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that state. The algorithm continues to visit states until it reaches the goal state or has visited all possible states. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the horizontal and vertical distances. This heuristic is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

The above code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The solution is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the horizontal and vertical distances. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The states are represented as a graph, where each node is a position on the grid and each edge is a jump from one trampoline to another. The cost of each jump is 1, and the heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the goal state. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest total cost first. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal state and returns the sequence of jumps taken.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The states are represented as tuples of the current position and the number of diagonal jumps made so far. The cost of reaching a state is the number of jumps made, and the heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the goal state. The algorithm generates all valid actions from the current state, which includes jumping to any of the eight adjacent trampolines, and adds the new states to a priority queue. The priority of each state is the sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal. The algorithm continues until it finds a path to the goal state or there are no more states to visit.

In the above code, we first define the initial state, goal state, and the grid of trampolines. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimate remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. We then start a while loop to iterate through the queue until it is empty. In each iteration, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state and the number of diagonal jumps is 3, we return the actions taken. Otherwise, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving to any of the eight adjacent trampolines. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance of the current position from the goal position.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The states are represented as tuples of the current position and the number of diagonal jumps made so far. The cost of reaching a state is the number of jumps made, and the heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the goal state plus the number of diagonal jumps still needed. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, checks if the new state is valid, and adds it to the queue of not-yet-visited states if it is unvisited or if a new path with a lower cost to reach this state is found. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that is the goal state and has made exactly 3 diagonal jumps, at which point it returns the actions taken to reach this state.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and the goal state. This heuristic is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The states are represented as tuples of the current position and the number of diagonal moves made so far. The cost of each state is the number of moves made, and the heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the goal state, with a penalty added if the number of diagonal moves is not 4. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving to any of the eight adjacent trampolines, and adds the new states to the queue of not-yet-visited states if they are valid and have a lower cost than the previously visited state. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or there are no more states to visit.

This heuristic is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The solution is a list of tuples, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and goal state. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic used is the Manhattan distance from the current state to the goal state, with an additional penalty if the number of diagonal moves is less than 4. This ensures that the search algorithm prioritizes paths with more diagonal moves, as we must make exactly 4 diagonal moves. The cost of reaching a state is the number of jumps made, as we are trying to minimize the number of jumps. The algorithm continues until it finds a path to the goal state or it has visited all possible states.

In this problem, the state is represented as a tuple of the current position and the number of diagonal jumps made so far. The goal state is when the current position is the goal position and the number of diagonal jumps made is exactly 4. The heuristic is the Manhattan distance from the current position to the goal position, as the shortest path to the goal position is the Manhattan distance, if there are no broken trampolines in the way. The heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state, as the shortest path to the goal position is the Manhattan distance, if there are no broken trampolines in the way. The heuristic is consistent because the cost of moving to a neighboring position is always 1, which is exactly the decrease in the Manhattan distance, if the position is moved toward the goal position.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from a given state is non-decreasing along the path.

{'difficulty': 13, 'statement': 'Alex is at a trampoline park with a grid of mini trampolines, arranged in a square of 13x13. Some trampolines are broken and unusable.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial position to the goal position. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal and the estimated cost of reaching the goal from a node is never greater than the cost of reaching the goal from its parent node plus the cost of reaching the node from its parent. The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal moves made and ensures that exactly 4 diagonal moves are made.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The A* search algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, and always expands the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal. The heuristic used in this problem is the Manhattan distance from the current state to the goal state, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the row and column indices of the current state and the goal state. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, as it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and is non-decreasing along the path to the goal state. The cost of reaching a state is the number of jumps made, as the task is to minimize the number of jumps required to reach the goal state. The states are represented as tuples of the row and column indices of the current position, and the actions are represented as tuples of the row and column indices of the new position. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes jumping to any of the 8 adjacent trampolines, and checks if the new state would be valid, ie the new position must be within the bounds of the park and the trampoline at the new position must not be broken. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or there are no more states to visit.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from a node is non-decreasing along the path. The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made and only considers a state as the goal state if the number of diagonal jumps made is exactly 4.

The above code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute values of the differences in the goal's x and y coordinates and the current x and y coordinates. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring that A* search will find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and the goal state. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from the current state is non-decreasing along the path. The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made and ensures that exactly 4 diagonal jumps are made.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and is non-decreasing along the path. The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made and ensures that exactly 4 diagonal jumps are made.

The code above uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial position to the goal position. The A* search algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, and always expands the node with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal. The heuristic used in this problem is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the horizontal and vertical distances, from the current position to the goal position. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality and efficiency of the A* search algorithm. The states are represented as a tuple of the current position and the number of diagonal jumps made so far, and the actions are represented as the coordinates of the trampolines jumped on. The cost of an action is always 1, as each action corresponds to a single jump. The algorithm continues to expand nodes until it reaches the goal state, at which point it returns the sequence of actions taken to reach the goal. If no path to the goal exists, the algorithm will eventually exhaust all possible states without finding the goal, and return None.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state and the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from a given state is non-decreasing along the path.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current position and the goal position. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring that A* search will find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial position to the goal position. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal (making it admissible) and the estimated cost to reach the goal from any state is non-decreasing along a path (making it consistent). The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made and ensures that exactly 5 diagonal jumps are made.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and the goal state. This heuristic is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and goal state. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring that A* search will find the optimal solution.

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, making it suitable for use in the A* algorithm. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that state. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or has visited all possible states.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial position to the goal position. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. The Manhattan distance is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal and the estimated cost of reaching the goal from a node is non-decreasing along the path. The code also keeps track of the number of diagonal jumps made and ensures that exactly 5 diagonal jumps are made.

The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', 5], 'is_correct': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', [12, 2], [3, 13], 5], 'Astar': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', '(12, 2)', '(3, 13)', '5'], 'opt': [[[12, 2], [11, 3], [10, 3], [9, 3], [8, 3], [7, 3], [6, 4], [6, 5], [6, 6], [6, 7], [5, 8], [4, 9], [4, 10], [4, 11], [3, 12], [3, 13]], 16, 0.03443431854248047]}
