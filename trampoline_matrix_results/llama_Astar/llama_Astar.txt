He is currently on the trampoline at position (12, 2) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (3, 13). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', 5], 'is_correct': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', [12, 2], [3, 13], 5], 'Astar': ['[[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]', '(12, 2)', '(3, 13)', '5'], 'opt': [[[12, 2], [11, 3], [10, 3], [9, 3], [8, 3], [7, 3], [6, 4], [6, 5], [6, 6], [6, 7], [5, 8], [4, 9], [4, 10], [4, 11], [3, 12], [3, 13]], 16, 0.03443431854248047]}
