Step 1: Alex is currently at position (0, 4) and wants to reach position (8, 0). The shortest path requires exactly 3 diagonal jumps. 

The possible diagonal jumps from (0, 4) are to (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 8).

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (8, 6) and wants to reach position (0, 0). The shortest path involves making 3 diagonal jumps. The path should be planned in such a way that Alex reaches the destination with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The possible paths are limited by the broken trampolines. We need to find a path that avoids the broken trampolines and allows Alex to make exactly 3 diagonal jumps.

Step 3: By analyzing the map, we can see that the following path is the shortest and fulfills the conditions:
(8, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 0)

Therefore, the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(8, 6), (7, 5), (6, 4), (5, 3), (4, 2), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting position to the destination while ensuring that exactly 3 diagonal jumps are made. Here are the steps to find the shortest path:

Step 1: Initialize the queue with the starting position (8, 8) and an empty path.
Step 2: Pop the current position and path from the queue.
Step 3: Check if the current position is the destination (2, 1). If it is, return the path.
Step 4: Generate all possible positions that can be reached from the current position by making a valid move (not jumping to a broken trampoline and ensuring exactly 3 diagonal jumps).
Step 5: Add the new positions to the queue with the updated path.
Step 6: Repeat steps 2-5 until the destination is reached.

After following the steps above, the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is:

[(8, 8), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]

The answer is /answer_list/[(8, 8), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (1, 10) and wants to reach position (9, 3). The shortest path with exactly 3 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the starting position as visited and enqueue it in the queue.

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (1, 10) and enqueue the valid ones in the queue. We continue this process, marking visited trampolines and enqueuing valid ones, until we reach the destination position (9, 3).

Step 3: The shortest sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is determined by backtracking from the destination to the starting position, following the parent pointers stored during the breadth-first search.

The final sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3)].

Step 2: The shortest path from (10, 10) to (5, 0) involves the following jumps: (10, 10) -> (9, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0).

Step 3: The sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(10, 10), (9, 9), (8, 8), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(10, 10), (9, 9), (8, 8), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (2, 1) and wants to reach position (10, 9). The shortest path with exactly 3 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the current position as visited and enqueue it in the queue. 

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (2, 1) and enqueue the valid ones in the queue. 

Step 3: We continue exploring the trampolines in the queue, making sure to keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far. 

Step 4: We repeat the process until we reach the destination trampoline at position (10, 9) with exactly 3 diagonal jumps. 

The final sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 8), (10, 9)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (0, 9) and wants to reach position (10, 0). The shortest path requires exactly 4 diagonal jumps. 

The path can be visualized as follows:
(0, 9) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (9, 0) -> (10, 1) -> (10, 0)

So, the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0), (10, 1), (10, 0)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0), (10, 1), (10, 0)]

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (1, 11) and wants to reach position (11, 3). The shortest path with exactly 4 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the starting position as visited and adding it to the queue.

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (1, 11) and add them to the queue if they are functional and have not been visited before. We continue this process, keeping track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far.

Step 3: As we explore the trampolines, we update the world model by marking the visited trampolines and keeping track of the path taken to reach each trampoline.

Step 4: We continue exploring the trampolines, making sure to only make 4 diagonal jumps in total. We keep track of the path taken to reach each trampoline and update the world model accordingly.

Step 5: Once we reach the destination trampoline at position (11, 3), we backtrack to reconstruct the shortest path taken by Alex to reach his destination. This path will be the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on, including the first and final trampolines.

The final sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(1, 11), (2, 10), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 6), (7, 5), (8, 4), (9, 3), (10, 2), (11, 3)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(1, 11), (2, 10), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 6), (7, 5), (8, 4), (9, 3), (10, 2), (11, 3)]

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (1, 7) and wants to reach position (10, 0). The shortest path requires exactly 4 diagonal jumps. 

The path can be visualized as follows:
(1, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 0) -> (9, 1) -> (10, 2) -> (10, 1) -> (10, 0)

So, the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (7, 1), (8, 0), (9, 1), (10, 2), (10, 1), (10, 0)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (11, 7) and wants to reach position (2, 0). The shortest path with exactly 4 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the current position as visited and enqueue it in the queue.

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (11, 7) that are not broken and are within the bounds of the grid. We enqueue these positions in the queue and mark them as visited.

Step 3: We continue exploring the trampolines in the queue, making sure to keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far. We only consider trampolines that are not broken and have not been visited before.

Step 4: We repeat the process until we reach the destination trampoline at position (2, 0) with exactly 4 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the path taken to reach the destination.

The final sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(11, 7), (10, 6), (9, 5), (8, 4), (7, 3), (6, 2), (5, 1), (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 0)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (11, 2) and wants to reach position (3, 10). The shortest path requires exactly 4 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The shortest path from (11, 2) to (3, 10) with 4 diagonal jumps is as follows:

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (0, 9) and wants to reach position (11, 2). The shortest path requires exactly 4 diagonal jumps. 

The shortest path can be achieved by moving diagonally towards the destination while avoiding broken trampolines. 

The path is as follows:
1. (0, 9) -> (1, 8)
2. (1, 8) -> (2, 7)
3. (2, 7) -> (3, 6)
4. (3, 6) -> (4, 5)

9. (8, 1) -> (9, 0)
10. (9, 0) -> (10, 1)
11. (10, 1) -> (11, 2)

The final sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0), (10, 1), (11, 2)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (3, 0). The trampoline at position (4, 1) is the closest functional trampoline that Alex can jump to. So, the first jump is from (3, 0) to (4, 1).

Step 2: From position (4, 1), Alex can jump to position (5, 2) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the second jump is from (4, 1) to (5, 2).

Step 3: From position (5, 2), Alex can jump to position (6, 3) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the third jump is from (5, 2) to (6, 3).

Step 4: From position (6, 3), Alex can jump to position (7, 4) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the fourth jump is from (6, 3) to (7, 4).

Step 5: From position (7, 4), Alex can jump to position (8, 5) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the fifth jump is from (7, 4) to (8, 5).

Step 6: From position (8, 5), Alex can jump to position (9, 6) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the sixth jump is from (8, 5) to (9, 6).

Step 7: From position (9, 6), Alex can jump to position (10, 7) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the seventh jump is from (9, 6) to (10, 7).

Step 8: From position (10, 7), Alex can jump to position (11, 8) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the eighth jump is from (10, 7) to (11, 8).

Step 9: From position (11, 8), Alex can jump to position (10, 9) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the ninth jump is from (11, 8) to (10, 9).

Step 10: From position (10, 9), Alex can jump to position (9, 10) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the tenth jump is from (10, 9) to (9, 10).

Step 11: From position (9, 10), Alex can jump to position (8, 11) as the next closest functional trampoline. So, the eleventh jump is from (9, 10) to (8, 11).

Step 12: From position (8, 11), Alex can jump to position (9, 11) as the final destination. So, the twelfth jump is from (8, 11) to (9, 11).

The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 5), (9, 6), (10, 7), (11, 8), (10, 9), (9, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (1, 12) and wants to reach position (8, 2). The shortest path with exactly 4 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the current position as visited and enqueue it in the queue. 

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position, considering only the ones that are functional (0) and have not been visited before. We continue this process until we reach the destination position (8, 2) with exactly 4 diagonal jumps.

Step 3: After exploring all possible paths, we backtrack from the destination position to the starting position to determine the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination.

The final sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(1, 12), (2, 11), (3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].

Step 3: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(0, 7), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 0), (8, 1), (9, 2), (10, 3), (11, 4), (12, 5), (11, 6), (10, 7), (11, 8), (12, 9), (11, 10), (10, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (11, 10), (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 5), (12, 4), (12, 3), (12, 2), (12, 1), (12, 0)]

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (7, 13) and wants to reach position (13, 0). The shortest path involves making 4 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (7, 13) to (13, 0) involves the following jumps: (7, 13) -> (8, 12) -> (9, 11) -> (10, 10) -> (11, 9) -> (12, 8) -> (13, 7) -> (13, 6) -> (13, 5) -> (13, 4) -> (13, 3) -> (13, 2) -> (13, 1) -> (13, 0).

Step 3: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(7, 13), (8, 12), (9, 11), (10, 10), (11, 9), (12, 8), (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 3), (13, 2), (13, 1), (13, 0)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(7, 13), (8, 12), (9, 11), (10, 10), (11, 9), (12, 8), (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 3), (13, 2), (13, 1), (13, 0)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (2, 13) and wants to reach position (8, 0). The shortest path involves making 4 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The shortest path from (2, 13) to (8, 0) involves the following jumps: (2, 13) -> (3, 12) -> (4, 11) -> (5, 10) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0).

Step 3: The list of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (9, 0) and wants to reach position (3, 13). The shortest path involves making 4 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The shortest path from (9, 0) to (3, 13) involves the following jumps:
(9, 0) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 7) -> (1, 8) -> (0, 9) -> (1, 10) -> (2, 11) -> (3, 12) -> (3, 13)

Step 3: The list of trampolines Alex jumps on to reach his destination is:
[(9, 0), (8, 1), (7, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (4, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7), (1, 8), (0, 9), (1, 10), (2, 11), (3, 12), (3, 13)]

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (12, 11) and wants to reach position (0, 4). The shortest path involves making 4 diagonal jumps. The path should be planned in a way that Alex avoids the broken trampolines and reaches the destination.

Step 2: The path can be visualized as a series of diagonal jumps from one trampoline to another, ensuring that Alex makes exactly 4 diagonal jumps. The path should be the shortest possible route while avoiding the broken trampolines.

Step 3: The path can be determined by considering the available trampolines that are not broken and are reachable from the current position. Alex should move towards the destination while making the required number of diagonal jumps.

Step 4: By analyzing the map of the trampoline park and considering the constraints of the problem, the shortest sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination can be determined.

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (14, 2) and wants to reach position (1, 9). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. The path should be calculated considering the broken and functional trampolines.

Step 2: The path should be calculated using a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path from the starting position to the destination while ensuring that Alex makes exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Step 3: The path should be updated based on the constraints of the problem, ensuring that Alex only jumps on functional trampolines and makes exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Step 4: The final path should be determined, considering the constraints and requirements of the problem, and presented as a list of tuples indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on.

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (10, 0) and wants to reach position (1, 12). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (10, 0) to (1, 12) involves the following diagonal jumps: (10, 0) -> (9, 1) -> (8, 2) -> (7, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 9) -> (0, 10) -> (1, 11) -> (1, 12).

Step 3: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(10, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (14, 10) and wants to reach position (2, 1). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (14, 10) to (2, 1) can be visualized as a series of diagonal jumps. 

Step 3: The path can be calculated by finding the shortest route that involves exactly 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 4: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is determined by calculating the path with 5 diagonal jumps.

The answer is /answer_list/[(14, 10), (13, 9), (12, 8), (11, 7), (10, 6), (9, 5), (8, 4), (7, 3), (6, 2), (5, 1), (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (13, 1) and wants to reach position (4, 13). The shortest path requires exactly 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (13, 1) to (4, 13) can be visualized as a series of diagonal jumps. We need to find the shortest path that satisfies the condition of exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

Step 3: One possible path from (13, 1) to (4, 13) with 5 diagonal jumps is as follows:
(13, 1) -> (12, 2) -> (11, 3) -> (10, 4) -> (9, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 9) -> (4, 10) -> (4, 11) -> (4, 12) -> (4, 13)

Step 4: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(13, 1), (12, 2), (11, 3), (10, 4), (9, 5), (8, 6), (7, 7), (6, 8), (5, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(13, 1), (12, 2), (11, 3), (10, 4), (9, 5), (8, 6), (7, 7), (6, 8), (5, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13)]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (3, 10) and wants to reach position (13, 0). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The shortest path from (3, 10) to (13, 0) involves the following jumps: (3, 10) -> (4, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (10, 3) -> (11, 2) -> (12, 1) -> (13, 0).

Therefore, the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 3), (11, 2), (12, 1), (13, 0)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 3), (11, 2), (12, 1), (13, 0)]
llm code run result: [(3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 3), (11, 2), (12, 1), (13, 0)]

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (11, 1) and wants to reach position (2, 12). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. We need to find the shortest path for Alex to reach his destination while making exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

The shortest path can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start at the initial position and explore all possible moves in all directions, keeping track of the number of diagonal jumps made. We continue this process until we reach the destination with exactly 5 diagonal jumps.

The final sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination is as follows:
[(11, 1), (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 10), (1, 11), (0, 12), (1, 13), (2, 12)]

Step 1: Alex starts at position (2, 2) and wants to reach position (13, 14). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (2, 2) to (13, 14) can be visualized as follows:
(2, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 9) -> (10, 10) -> (11, 11) -> (12, 12) -> (13, 13) -> (14, 14) -> (13, 14)

Step 3: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9), (10, 10), (11, 11), (12, 12), (13, 13), (14, 14), (13, 14)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
Step 1: Alex is currently at position (0, 3) and wants to reach position (14, 11). The shortest path involves making 5 diagonal jumps. 

Step 2: The path from (0, 3) to (14, 11) can be visualized as a series of diagonal jumps. 

Step 3: The path can be calculated by finding the shortest route while ensuring that exactly 5 diagonal jumps are made.

Step 4: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is determined by calculating the path that satisfies the given conditions.

The answer is /answer_list/[(0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10), (8, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (11, 10), (12, 9), (13, 8), (14, 9), (14, 10), (14, 11)].

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (14, 13) and wants to reach position (2, 5). The shortest path with exactly 5 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the current position as visited and enqueue it in the queue.

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (14, 13) that are not broken and are within the bounds of the grid. We enqueue these positions in the queue and mark them as visited.

Step 3: We continue exploring the trampolines in the queue, making sure to keep track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far. We only enqueue trampolines that are not broken and have not been visited before.

Step 4: We repeat the process until we reach the destination trampoline at position (2, 5) with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We keep track of the path taken to reach the destination.

Step 5: The shortest sequence of trampolines that Alex should jump on to reach his destination, including the first and final trampolines, is determined based on the path taken during the breadth-first search.

The answer is /answer_list/[(14, 13), (13, 12), (12, 11), (11, 10), (10, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5)]

Step 1: Alex is currently at position (10, 1) and wants to reach position (3, 14). The shortest path with exactly 5 diagonal jumps can be found using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by marking the starting position as visited and enqueue it in the queue.

Step 2: We explore the adjacent trampolines of the current position (10, 1) and enqueue the valid ones in the queue. We continue this process, keeping track of the number of diagonal jumps made so far.

Step 3: After exploring all possible paths, we reach the destination position (3, 14) with exactly 5 diagonal jumps. We backtrack from the destination to the starting position to find the shortest path.

Step 4: The shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination is [(10, 1), (9, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4), (6, 5), (5, 6), (4, 7), (3, 8), (2, 9), (1, 10), (0, 11), (1, 12), (2, 13), (3, 14)].
