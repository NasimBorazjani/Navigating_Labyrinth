Code passed constraints!! Complete code extractred, code is excutable and the type of the solution returned is correct!!

The problem can be solved using an A* search algorithm. First, we will represent the grid as a graph where nodes are the trampolines and edges are the possible jumps between trampolines. The heuristic function will be the Manhattan distance between the current node and the destination node, considering that Alex must make exactly 3 diagonal jumps. The cost function will be the number of jumps made so far.
