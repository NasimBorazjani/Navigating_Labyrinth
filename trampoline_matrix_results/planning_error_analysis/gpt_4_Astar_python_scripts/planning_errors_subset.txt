This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and goal state. This heuristic is both admissible and consistent, ensuring that A* search will find the optimal solution.

He is currently on the trampoline at position (0, 3) (positions are counted from 0, left to right, top to bottom) and wants to reach the trampoline at position (14, 11). What is the shortest sequence of trampolines he should jump on to reach his destination (including the first and final trampolines)? The answer should be a list of tuples, in Python syntax, indicating the row and column of each trampoline Alex jumps on. \n1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1', 'is_feasible': ['[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', 5], 'is_correct': ['[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', [0, 3], [14, 11], 5], 'Astar': ['[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]', '(0, 3)', '(14, 11)', '5'], 'opt': [[[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5], [7, 5], [8, 5], [9, 5], [9, 6], [10, 7], [11, 8], [12, 9], [13, 10], [14, 11]], 18, 0.027624130249023438]}

This code will return the shortest sequence of trampolines Alex should jump on to reach his destination. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the current state and the goal state. This heuristic is both admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current node to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).
