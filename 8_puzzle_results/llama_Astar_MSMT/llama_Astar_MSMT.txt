```

In this code, we first initialize the visited_costs dictionary and the priority queue. Then, we define the initial state of the puzzle and the goal state. The a_star function implements the A* search algorithm. In each iteration, it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal from the queue, and checks if the current state is the goal state. If it is, it returns the actions taken. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which involves swapping the empty spot with any of the 8 neighboring spots, and checks if the new state would be valid. If it is, it adds the new state to the queue of un-visited states. The solution is reported as a list of numbers in Python format, where each number represents the number on the tile that the empty spot is swapped with at each turn.

```

In this code, we first initialize the initial state of the puzzle, the number of rows and columns, and the visited_costs and priority queue. Then, we implement the A* search algorithm in the a_star function. In each iteration of the while loop, we pop the state with the lowest cost from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken. Otherwise, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes swapping the empty spot with any of the 8 neighboring tiles. We then check if the new state is valid, ie the new spot is within the bounds of the grid. If it is, we generate the new state and update the cost and actions accordingly. If the new state has not been visited before or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we push the new state into the queue. Finally, we return the actions taken to solve the puzzle.

{'difficulty': 3, 'statement': "In the 8-puzzle game, you are given a grid with numbered square tiles arranged randomly and one tile missing. The goal is to arrange the tiles in descending order by sliding them into the empty space. The tiles can move in 4 directions: left, right, up, and down.  Given the initial state of the puzzle below, where the empty spot is represented as “_”, provide the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The goal state is when all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. The solution should be a list of numbers in Python format, where each number represents the number on the tile that the empty spot is swapped with at each turn. Initial state of the puzzle: [[93, 88, 60], [28, 18, 24], ['_', 47, 53]]", 'is_feasible': [[[93, 88, 60], [28, 18, 24], ['_', 47, 53]]], 'is_correct': [[[93, 88, 60], [28, 18, 24], ['_', 47, 53]]], 'Astar': ["[[93, 88, 60], [28, 18, 24], ['_', 47, 53]]"], 'opt': [[47, 53, 24, 18, 28, 47, 53, 24, 18, 28, 47, 53, 24, 18], 14, 0.022923946380615234]}
