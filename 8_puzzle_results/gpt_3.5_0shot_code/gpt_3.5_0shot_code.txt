To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

Here is the Python script to solve the 8-puzzle problem:

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

# Define the initial state of the puzzle
initial_state = [[12, 55, '_'], [35, 97, 43], [17, 25, 9]]

# Define the goal state of the puzzle

                return (i, j)

# Define a function to generate the possible moves from a given state
def generate_moves(state):
    moves = []
    empty_spot = find_empty_spot(state)
    x, y = empty_spot
    if x > 0:
        moves.append((x-1, y))
    if x < 2:

            if str(new_state) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[str(new_state)]:
                cost_so_far[str(new_state)] = new_cost
                priority = new_cost + manhattan_distance(find_empty_spot(new_state), (2, 2))
                frontier.put((priority, new_state))

    return moves

# Solve the puzzle and print the list of tiles to be swapped
solution = solve_puzzle(initial_state, goal_state)
print(solution)
```

In this script, we first define the initial state and the goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to explore the states of the puzzle in the order of their estimated cost to reach the goal state. It keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and the path taken to reach that state. Once the goal state is reached, the function reconstructs the path from the goal state to the initial state and extracts the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn.

Finally, the script solves the puzzle and prints the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script, we first define the initial state and the goal state of the puzzle. We then define functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, the total Manhattan distance of the puzzle state, and the possible moves from a given state. 

Next, we implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest total Manhattan distance first. 

Finally, we call the `a_star_search` function with the initial state and goal state to find the shortest path of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The result is printed out as a list of numbers representing the tiles swapped at each turn.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state by summing the distances of each tile from its goal position.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state using the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. Finally, we call the `a_star_search` function with the initial state `[[87, 50, 82], [68, '_', 74], [23, 61, 11]]` and print the solution path.

```

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state `[[77, 49, '_'], [56, 72, 74], [96, 33, 59]]` and print the solution. The solution will be a list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The steps to achieve the goal state are as follows:

1. Define a function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points on the grid.
2. Define a function to find the possible moves from the current state of the puzzle.
3. Define a function to generate the next state of the puzzle after making a move.
4. Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state.
5. Run the algorithm with the initial state provided and return the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the state is defined by the arrangement of the tiles on the grid.

```

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by moving the empty spot in all possible directions.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state from the initial state.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem, and print the solution which is the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

            new_state[empty_row][empty_col], new_state[i][j] = new_state[i][j], new_state[empty_row][empty_col]
            neighbors.append(new_state)

```

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the puzzle.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
4. We initialize the initial state of the puzzle and call the `a_star_search` function to find the solution.
5. Finally, we print the solution, which is a list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

```

In this script, we first define the initial state and the goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to explore the search space efficiently and keep track of the cost of each state. It iterates through the possible moves from the current state, calculates the cost of each move, and updates the priority queue and cost dictionary accordingly. Once the goal state is reached, the function reconstructs the path from the goal state to the initial state and extracts the list of numbers to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn.

Finally, the script solves the puzzle and prints the list of tiles to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

In this script, we first define the initial state and goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to explore the states of the puzzle in the order of their estimated cost to reach the goal state. It keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and the path taken to reach that state. Once the goal state is reached, the function reconstructs the path from the goal state to the initial state by backtracking through the `came_from` dictionary.

Finally, the script solves the puzzle and prints the list of tiles to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The steps involved in the Python script are as follows:

1. Define the initial state of the puzzle as a 2D list.
2. Define the goal state of the puzzle as a 2D list with tiles arranged in descending order and the empty spot at the bottom right corner.
3. Define a function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points on the grid.
4. Define a function to find the possible moves from a given state of the puzzle.
5. Define a function to perform the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic.
6. Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. This heuristic function is used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal state from the current state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.
3. The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue to explore states with lower costs first.
4. The script then defines the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped to achieve the goal state. Finally, it prints the solution.

We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

Here is the Python script to solve the 8-puzzle problem:

# Solve the puzzle

```

In this script, we first define the initial state and the goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to keep track of the states to explore next based on their cost. The cost is calculated as the number of moves made so far plus the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. The function continues exploring states until it reaches the goal state or exhausts all possible states.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state and goal state to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The solution is then printed out.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance between the current state of the puzzle and the goal state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.
3. The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
4. The script then solves the given initial state of the puzzle and prints the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

You can run this script to get the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

In this script, we first define the initial state and goal state of the puzzle. We then define functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between tiles, the total Manhattan distance of a state, and get possible moves from a given state. Next, we implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state by considering the total cost of moving from the initial state to the goal state. Finally, we print the solution, which is the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state using the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. The initial state is defined as `[[85, 73, 14], [79, 23, 50], ['_', 99, 63]]`.
5. The script then calls the `a_star_search` function to find the shortest path and prints the solution.

In this script, we first define the initial state and the goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to explore the search space efficiently. It keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and the path taken to reach that state. Once the goal state is reached, the function reconstructs the path from the goal state to the initial state and extracts the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state and goal state, and print the list of tiles that need to be swapped to achieve the goal state.

```

In this script, we first define the `manhattan_distance` function to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We also define the `get_neighbors` function to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

We then call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state `[[78, 69, '_'], [68, 49, 95], [74, 15, 39]]` to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, we print the solution.

```

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent of each state in the path, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

Once the goal state is reached, the function reconstructs the path by backtracking through the `came_from` dictionary and returns the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem and print the solution.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then initializes the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, it prints the solution.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state of the puzzle. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the frontier of the search and a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent nodes of each state in the search tree. The algorithm iterates through the frontier, expanding nodes and updating the cost and parent information as needed.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem, and print the resulting solution. The solution is a list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then calls the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state of the puzzle and prints the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state using the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. The initial state is defined as `[[69, 92, 89, 72], [82, 13, 65, 59], [45, '_', 67, 8]]`.
5. The script then calls the `a_star_search` function to find the solution and prints the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

In this script, we first define the initial state and goal state of the puzzle. We then implement helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and calculate the heuristic value of a state.

Next, we define the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore states with the lowest cost first. We also keep track of the cost of reaching each state and the path taken to reach that state.

Finally, we call the `a_star_search` function with the initial state to solve the 8-puzzle problem and print the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script, we first define the `manhattan_distance` function to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. We also define the `get_neighbors` function to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then finds the shortest path by backtracking from the goal state to the initial state using the `came_from` dictionary. Finally, it prints the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then applies the `solve_puzzle` function to the initial state provided in the problem and prints the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current state and the goal state. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent of each state, and a dictionary `g_score` to store the cost of reaching each state from the initial state.

The algorithm iterates through the states in the priority queue, expanding each state by generating its neighbors and updating the cost of reaching each neighbor. If a neighbor has not been visited before or has a lower cost, it is added to the priority queue. Once the goal state is reached, the algorithm reconstructs the path from the initial state to the goal state using the `came_from` dictionary.

Finally, the script solves the given initial state of the puzzle and prints the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script, we first define the `manhattan_distance` function to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define the `get_neighbors` function to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then finds the shortest path by backtracking from the goal state to the initial state using the `came_from` dictionary. Finally, it prints the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

This script defines the initial state, goal state, and functions to calculate the Manhattan distance, find possible moves, and perform the A* search algorithm. The `a_star_search` function uses a priority queue to explore the possible moves and find the shortest path to the goal state. Finally, the script prints the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

```

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We also define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

We then call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem. The function returns the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, we print the solution.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the puzzle.
3. The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
4. The script then defines the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.
5. Finally, the script prints the solution, which is a list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn.

```

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

We then call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem. The function returns the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, we print the solution.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then initializes the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, it prints the solution in Python format.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The steps to achieve the goal state are as follows:

1. Define a function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points on the grid.
2. Define a function to find the possible moves from the current state of the puzzle.
3. Define a function to generate the next state of the puzzle after making a move.
4. Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state.
5. Start with the initial state of the puzzle and apply the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state.
6. Return the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot at each turn to achieve the goal state.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.

4. The initial state of the puzzle is defined, and the `a_star_search` function is called to find the solution.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent state of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then initializes the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. Finally, it prints the solution.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state by summing the distances of each tile from its goal position.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible states that can be reached from a given state by moving the empty spot in one of the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state by considering the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. Finally, we define the initial state of the puzzle and call the `a_star_search` function to find the shortest path. The result is printed out, which represents the number of steps needed to reach the goal state.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `find_empty_spot` function is used to find the row and column indices of the empty spot in the puzzle grid.
2. The `is_goal_state` function checks if the puzzle is in the goal state where all tiles are in descending order and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner.
3. The `swap_tiles` function is used to swap the empty spot with a numbered tile at the specified row and column indices.
4. The `solve_puzzle` function repeatedly finds the empty spot, determines the next move to make based on its position, swaps the empty spot with a numbered tile, and appends the number of the tile to the `moves` list.
5. The initial state of the puzzle is defined, and the `solve_puzzle` function is called to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped to achieve the goal state.
6. The solution list is printed, which contains the numbers of the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot in each turn.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state by summing the distances of each tile from its goal position.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state by considering the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. Finally, we call the `a_star_search` function with the initial state provided in the problem to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped to achieve the goal state.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We will represent each state of the puzzle as a node in the search tree, where the edges between nodes represent the possible moves of swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

Here is the Python script to solve the 8-puzzle problem:

    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(5):

    while not frontier.empty():
        _, current_state = frontier.get()

        if current_state == goal_state:
            break

        for next_move in generate_moves(current_state):
            new_state = [row.copy() for row in current_state]

            new_cost = cost_so_far[str(current_state)] + 1

            if str(new_state) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[str(new_state)]:
                cost_so_far[str(new_state)] = new_cost
                priority = new_cost + manhattan_distance(next_move, find_empty_spot(new_state))
                frontier.put((priority, new_state))

    # Reconstruct the path from the goal state to the initial state
    path = []
    current = str(goal_state)
    while current != str(initial_state):

    return path[::-1]

# Solve the puzzle and print the list of tiles to be swapped
solution = solve_puzzle(initial_state, goal_state)
print(solution)
```

In this script, we first define the initial state and goal state of the puzzle. We then define helper functions to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points, find the empty spot in the puzzle, generate possible moves from a given state, and solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses a priority queue to explore the possible moves and find the shortest path to the goal state. It calculates the cost of each move based on the Manhattan distance and updates the cost and priority in the frontier queue.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state and goal state to get the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The solution is then printed out.

To solve this problem, we can use the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The steps to achieve the goal state are as follows:

1. Define the initial state of the puzzle:
```python
initial_state = [[98, 74, 70, 26, 65], [91, 55, 12, '_', 68], [27, 18, 67, 40, 54]]
```

2. Define the goal state of the puzzle:
```python
goal_state = [[98, 74, 70, 65, 54], [91, 67, 40, 26, 68], [55, 27, 18, 12, '_']]
```

3. Define a function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two tiles:
```python
def manhattan_distance(tile1, tile2):
    x1, y1 = tile1
    x2, y2 = tile2
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
```

4. Define a function to find the empty spot in the puzzle:
```python
def find_empty_spot(state):
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(len(state[i])):
            if state[i][j] == '_':
                return (i, j)
```

5. Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal state:
```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

def solve_puzzle(initial_state, goal_state):
    frontier = PriorityQueue()
    frontier.put((0, initial_state))
    came_from = {}
    cost_so_far = {}
    came_from[str(initial_state)] = None
    cost_so_far[str(initial_state)] = 0
    
    while not frontier.empty():
        current_cost, current_state = frontier.get()
        
        if current_state == goal_state:
            break
        
        empty_spot = find_empty_spot(current_state)
        possible_moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        
        for move in possible_moves:
            new_state = [row[:] for row in current_state]
            x, y = empty_spot
            new_x, new_y = x + move[0], y + move[1]
            
            if 0 <= new_x < len(new_state) and 0 <= new_y < len(new_state[0]):
                new_state[x][y], new_state[new_x][new_y] = new_state[new_x][new_y], new_state[x][y]
                new_cost = current_cost + 1
                
                if str(new_state) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[str(new_state)]:
                    cost_so_far[str(new_state)] = new_cost
                    priority = new_cost + manhattan_distance((new_x, new_y), (len(new_state)-1, len(new_state[0])-1))
                    frontier.put((priority, new_state))
                    came_from[str(new_state)] = current_state
    
    path = []
    current_state = goal_state
    while current_state != initial_state:
        previous_state = came_from[str(current_state)]
        empty_spot = find_empty_spot(current_state)
        x, y = empty_spot
        prev_x, prev_y = find_empty_spot(previous_state)
        path.append(current_state[x][y])
        current_state[x][y], current_state[prev_x][prev_y] = current_state[prev_x][prev_y], current_state[x][y]
        current_state = previous_state
    
    return path[::-1]

solution = solve_puzzle(initial_state, goal_state)
print(solution)
```

This script will output the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic is used to find the optimal path. The final solution is a list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped at each turn.

In this script:

2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the four directions.
3. The `a_star_search` function performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
4. The script initializes the initial state and calls the `a_star_search` function to find the solution.
5. Finally, it prints the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighbor states by moving the empty spot in the puzzle.
3. The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state by considering the Manhattan distance heuristic.
4. Finally, we define the initial state of the puzzle and call the `solve_puzzle` function to find the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state. The solution is then printed out.

In this script, we first define a function `manhattan_distance` to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We then define a function `get_neighbors` to generate the neighboring states of a given state by swapping the empty spot with a neighboring tile.

The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. It maintains a priority queue `frontier` to store the states to be explored, a dictionary `came_from` to store the parent states of each state, and a dictionary `cost_so_far` to store the cost of reaching each state.

The script then finds the shortest path by backtracking from the goal state to the initial state using the `came_from` dictionary and returns the list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

Finally, we call the `solve_puzzle` function with the initial state provided in the problem and print the solution.

In this script:
1. The `manhattan_distance` function calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state.
2. The `get_neighbors` function generates all possible neighboring states by moving the empty spot in the puzzle.
3. The `solve_puzzle` function uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
4. The script then defines the initial state of the puzzle and calls the `solve_puzzle` function to find the solution.
5. Finally, the script prints the list of numbers representing the tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state.

print(steps)
```

In this script, we first define the `manhattan_distance` function to calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for a given state. We also define the `get_neighbors` function to generate all possible neighbor states by moving the empty spot in the puzzle.

The `a_star_search` function implements the A* search algorithm using the Manhattan distance heuristic. It maintains a priority queue of states to explore, and at each step, it expands the state with the lowest estimated cost. The algorithm terminates when the goal state is reached.

Finally, we define the initial state of the puzzle and call the `a_star_search` function to find the shortest path to the goal state. The script then prints the number of steps required to reach the goal state.
