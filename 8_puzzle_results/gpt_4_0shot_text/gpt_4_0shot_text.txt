To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[12, 55, '_'], [35, 97, 43], [17, 25, 9]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[97, 55, 43], [35, 25, 17], [12, 9, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

Here are the steps:

1. Swap '_' and 97. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[12, 55, 97], [35, '_', 43], [17, 25, 9]]
2. Swap '_' and 55. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[12, '_', 97], [35, 55, 43], [17, 25, 9]]
3. Swap '_' and 12. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[_, 12, 97], [35, 55, 43], [17, 25, 9]]
4. Swap '_' and 35. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [_, 55, 43], [17, 25, 9]]
5. Swap '_' and 55. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [55, _, 43], [17, 25, 9]]
6. Swap '_' and 43. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [55, 43, _], [17, 25, 9]]
7. Swap '_' and 9. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [55, 43, 9], [17, 25, _]]
8. Swap '_' and 25. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [55, 43, 9], [17, _, 25]]
9. Swap '_' and 17. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, 12, 97], [55, 43, 9], [_, 17, 25]]
10. Swap '_' and 12. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[35, _, 97], [55, 43, 9], [12, 17, 25]]
11. Swap '_' and 35. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[_, 35, 97], [55, 43, 9], [12, 17, 25]]
12. Swap '_' and 55. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [_, 43, 9], [12, 17, 25]]
13. Swap '_' and 43. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [43, _, 9], [12, 17, 25]]
14. Swap '_' and 9. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [43, 9, _], [12, 17, 25]]
15. Swap '_' and 25. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [43, 9, 25], [12, 17, _]]
16. Swap '_' and 17. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [43, 9, 25], [12, _, 17]]
17. Swap '_' and 12. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [43, 9, 25], [_, 12, 17]]
18. Swap '_' and 43. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [_, 9, 25], [43, 12, 17]]
19. Swap '_' and 9. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [9, _, 25], [43, 12, 17]]
20. Swap '_' and 25. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [9, 25, _], [43, 12, 17]]
21. Swap '_' and 17. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[55, 35, 97], [9, 25, 17], [43, 12, _]]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is: [97, 55, 12, 35, 55, 43, 9, 25, 17, 12, 35, 55, 43, 9, 25, 17, 12, 43, 9, 25, 17]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[100, 99, 69], [63, 53, 40], [30, 19, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the tile that has the number 100. This will result in the following state: [[99, 69, 19], [53, 100, 30], ['_', 63, 40]]

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 63. This will result in the following state: [[99, 69, 19], [53, 100, 30], [63, '_', 40]]

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 53. This will result in the following state: [[99, 69, 19], ['_', 100, 30], [63, 53, 40]]

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 99. This will result in the following state: [['_', 69, 19], [99, 100, 30], [63, 53, 40]]

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[77, 49, '_'], [56, 72, 74], [96, 33, 59]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[96, 77, 74], [72, 56, 49], [33, 59, '_']]

We can achieve the goal state by following these steps:

1. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 49. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[77, '_', 49], [56, 72, 74], [96, 33, 59]]
2. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 77. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[ '_', 77, 49], [56, 72, 74], [96, 33, 59]]
3. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 56. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[56, 77, 49], ['_', 72, 74], [96, 33, 59]]
4. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 72. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[56, 77, 49], [72, '_', 74], [96, 33, 59]]
5. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 77. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[56, '_', 49], [72, 77, 74], [96, 33, 59]]
6. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 56. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[ '_', 56, 49], [72, 77, 74], [96, 33, 59]]
7. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 96. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[96, 56, 49], [72, 77, 74], ['_', 33, 59]]
8. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 33. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[96, 56, 49], [72, 77, 74], [33, '_', 59]]
9. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 59. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[96, 56, 49], [72, 77, 74], [33, 59, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [49, 77, 56, 72, 77, 56, 96, 33, 59].

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[68, 43, 31], [30, 23, 19], [12, 6, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the tile that has the number 68. This will move the number 68 to the top right corner of the grid. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 43. This will move the number 43 to the top middle spot of the grid. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 31. This will move the number 31 to the top left spot of the grid. 

After that, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 30. This will move the number 30 to the middle right spot of the grid. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 23. This will move the number 23 to the middle middle spot of the grid. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 19. This will move the number 19 to the middle left spot of the grid. 

Finally, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 12. This will move the number 12 to the bottom right spot of the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[66, 35, 51], [76, '_', 73], [90, 54, 22]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[90, 76, 73], [66, 54, 51], [35, 22, '_']]

We can achieve the goal state by following these steps:

1. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 76. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[66, 35, 51], ['_', 76, 73], [90, 54, 22]]
2. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 66. The state of the puzzle becomes: ['_', [35, 51], [76, 73], [90, 54, 22]]
3. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 90. The state of the puzzle becomes: [90, [35, 51], [76, 73], ['_', 54, 22]]
4. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 54. The state of the puzzle becomes: [90, [35, 51], [76, 73], [54, '_', 22]]
5. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 22. The state of the puzzle becomes: [90, [35, 51], [76, 73], [54, 22, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [76, 66, 90, 54, 22].

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[41, 36, 82], 
 [29, 97, 43], 
 ['_', 51, 61]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[97, 82, 61], 
 [51, 43, 41], 
 [36, 29, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

Here is the sequence of swaps:

1. Swap '_' with 97. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[41, 36, 82], [29, '_', 43], [97, 51, 61]]
2. Swap '_' with 82. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[41, 36, '_'], [29, 82, 43], [97, 51, 61]]
3. Swap '_' with 61. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[41, 36, 61], [29, 82, 43], [97, 51, '_']]
4. Swap '_' with 51. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[41, 36, 61], [29, 82, 43], [97, '_', 51]]
5. Swap '_' with 43. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[41, 36, 61], [29, 82, '_'], [97, 43, 51]]
6. Swap '_' with 41. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[ '_', 36, 61], [29, 82, 41], [97, 43, 51]]
7. Swap '_' with 36. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, '_', 61], [29, 82, 41], [97, 43, 51]]
8. Swap '_' with 29. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, 29, 61], ['_', 82, 41], [97, 43, 51]]
9. Swap '_' with 82. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, 29, 61], [82, '_', 41], [97, 43, 51]]
10. Swap '_' with 41. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, 29, 61], [82, 41, '_'], [97, 43, 51]]
11. Swap '_' with 43. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, 29, 61], [82, 41, 43], [97, '_', 51]]
12. Swap '_' with 51. The state of the puzzle becomes: [[36, 29, 61], [82, 41, 43], [97, 51, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [97, 82, 61, 51, 43, 41, 36, 29, 82, 41, 43, 51].

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[46, 50, 97], [92, 49, 99], [91, 25, '_']]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[99, 97, 92], [91, 50, 49], [46, 25, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the tile that has the number 99. This will move the number 99 to the top right corner. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 97. This will move the number 97 to the top middle spot. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 92. This will move the number 92 to the top left spot. 

After that, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 91. This will move the number 91 to the middle left spot. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 50. This will move the number 50 to the middle spot. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 49. This will move the number 49 to the middle right spot. 

Finally, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 46. This will move the number 46 to the bottom left spot. 

The sequence of tile swaps is: 99, 97, 92, 91, 50, 49, 46.

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[56, 79, '_'], [43, 89, 94], [36, 52, 25]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[94, 89, 79], [56, 52, 43], [36, 25, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

Here is the sequence of swaps:

1. Swap '_' with 94: [[56, 79, 94], [43, 89, '_'], [36, 52, 25]]
2. Swap '_' with 89: [[56, 79, 94], [43, '_', 89], [36, 52, 25]]
3. Swap '_' with 79: [[56, '_', 94], [43, 79, 89], [36, 52, 25]]
4. Swap '_' with 56: [[_, 56, 94], [43, 79, 89], [36, 52, 25]]
5. Swap '_' with 52: [[52, 56, 94], [43, 79, 89], [36, _, 25]]
6. Swap '_' with 43: [[52, 56, 94], [_, 79, 89], [43, 52, 25]]
7. Swap '_' with 36: [[52, 56, 94], [36, 79, 89], [43, 52, 25], [_, 79, 89]]
8. Swap '_' with 25: [[52, 56, 94], [36, 79, 89], [43, 52, _], [25, 79, 89]]

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: [[85, 73, 14], [79, 23, 50], ['_', 99, 63]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: [[99, 85, 79], [73, 63, 50], [23, 14, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the tile that has the number 99. This will move the number 99 to the top left corner of the grid. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 85. This will move the number 85 to the second position in the top row. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 79. This will move the number 79 to the third position in the top row. 

After that, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 73. This will move the number 73 to the first position in the second row. 

Next, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 63. This will move the number 63 to the second position in the second row. 

Then, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 50. This will move the number 50 to the third position in the second row. 

Finally, we can swap the empty spot with the tile that has the number 23, and then with the tile that has the number 14. This will move the numbers 23 and 14 to the first and second positions in the third row, respectively, and the empty spot to the bottom right corner.

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. In this case, the largest number is 90, which is currently in the second row, third column. So, the first swap is with the tile 90.

After the first swap, the state of the puzzle is:

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[12, 78, 19, '_'], 
 [94, 66, 67, 49], 
 [28, 83, 31, 47]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[94, 83, 78, 67], 
 [66, 49, 47, 31], 
 [28, 19, 12, '_']]

We can start by moving the largest number, 94, to the top left corner. This can be done by swapping 94 with 12, then 78, then 19, and finally with the empty spot. 

Next, we move 83 to the second spot in the top row. This can be done by swapping 83 with 66, then 67, then 49, then 31, then 47, then 28, then 19, then 12, and finally with the empty spot. 

We continue this process until all tiles are in their correct positions.

To solve the 8-puzzle game, we need to swap the empty spot with the tiles in a certain order to achieve the goal state. The goal state is when all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 
[[81, 10, 54, '_'], 
 [89, 77, 33, 29], 
 [26, 44, 61, 18]]

The goal state of the puzzle is: 
[[89, 81, 77, 61], 
 [54, 44, 33, 29], 
 [26, 18, 10, '_']]

To achieve the goal state, we need to swap the empty spot with the following tiles in order: 54, 10, 81, 89, 77, 33, 29, 26, 44, 61, 54, 44, 33, 29, 26, 18, 10.

3. Swap the empty spot with 93 (from the second row, fourth column)
4. Swap the empty spot with 98 (from the first row, second column)

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [85, 89, 93, 98].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[10, 96, 60, '_'], 
 [98, 73, 14, 58], 
 [53, 3, 21, 67]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[98, 96, 73, 67], 
 [60, 58, 53, 21], 
 [14, 10, 3, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

Here is the sequence of swaps:

1. Swap '_' with 98: [[10, 96, 60, 98], [ '_', 73, 14, 58], [53, 3, 21, 67]]
2. Swap '_' with 96: [[10, '_', 60, 98], [96, 73, 14, 58], [53, 3, 21, 67]]
3. Swap '_' with 73: [[10, 73, 60, 98], [96, '_', 14, 58], [53, 3, 21, 67]]
4. Swap '_' with 67: [[10, 73, 60, 98], [96, 67, 14, 58], [53, 3, 21, '_']]
5. Swap '_' with 21: [[10, 73, 60, 98], [96, 67, 14, 58], [53, 3, '_', 67]]
6. Swap '_' with 14: [[10, 73, 60, 98], [96, 67, '_', 58], [53, 3, 14, 67]]
7. Swap '_' with 60: [[10, 73, '_', 98], [96, 67, 60, 58], [53, 3, 14, 67]]
8. Swap '_' with 58: [[10, 73, 58, 98], [96, 67, 60, '_'], [53, 3, 14, 67]]
9. Swap '_' with 53: [[10, 73, 58, 98], [96, 67, 60, 53], ['_', 3, 14, 67]]
10. Swap '_' with 10: [['_', 73, 58, 98], [96, 67, 60, 53], [10, 3, 14, 67]]
11. Swap '_' with 3: [[3, 73, 58, 98], [96, 67, 60, 53], ['_', 10, 14, 67]]
12. Swap '_' with 10: [[3, 73, 58, 98], [96, 67, 60, 53], [10, '_', 14, 67]]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [98, 96, 73, 67, 21, 14, 60, 58, 53, 10, 3, 10].

Here is the sequence of swaps:

1. Swap '_' with 92
2. Swap '_' with 87
3. Swap '_' with 72
4. Swap '_' with 69
5. Swap '_' with 67
6. Swap '_' with 53
7. Swap '_' with 42
8. Swap '_' with 35
9. Swap '_' with 31
10. Swap '_' with 28
11. Swap '_' with 19

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[93, 83, 50, 21, 67], 
 [59, '_', 60, 19, 8], 
 [14, 12, 92, 54, 9]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[93, 92, 83, 67, 60], 
 [59, 54, 50, 21, 19], 
 [14, 12, 9, 8, '_']]

To reach the goal state from the initial state, we can follow these steps:

1. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 60. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[93, 83, 50, 21, 67], 
 [59, 60, '_', 19, 8], 
 [14, 12, 92, 54, 9]]

2. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 92. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[93, 83, 50, 21, 67], 
 [59, 60, 92, 19, 8], 
 [14, 12, '_', 54, 9]]

3. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 54. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[93, 83, 50, 21, 67], 
 [59, 60, 92, 19, 8], 
 [14, 12, 54, '_', 9]]

4. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 9. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[93, 83, 50, 21, 67], 
 [59, 60, 92, 19, 8], 
 [14, 12, 54, 9, '_']]

This is the goal state. So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [60, 92, 54, 9].

Initial state of the puzzle: [['_', 92, 90, 50, 40], [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]", 'is_feasible': [[['_', 92, 90, 50, 40], [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]], 'is_correct': [[['_', 92, 90, 50, 40], [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]], 'Astar': ["[['_', 92, 90, 50, 40], [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]"], 'opt': [[52, 39, 56, 51, 31, 56, 51, 36, 39, 52, 92, 90, 50, 83, 56, 50, 83, 56, 70, 49, 16, 40, 56, 70, 49, 16], 26, 0.03201866149902344]}

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is:
[['_', 92, 90, 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:
[[92, 90, 83, 70, 56], 
 [52, 51, 50, 49, 40], 
 [39, 36, 31, 16, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number adjacent to it, and continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

Here is the sequence of swaps:

1. Swap '_' with 92. The grid becomes:
[[92, '_', 90, 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

2. Swap '_' with 90. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, '_', 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, 83, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

3. Swap '_' with 83. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, '_', 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

4. Swap '_' with 70. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, '_', 49]]

5. Swap '_' with 56. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 50, 40], 
 [52, 39, 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, 56, '_', 70, 49]]

6. Swap '_' with 52. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 50, 40], 
 [52, '_', 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

7. Swap '_' with 51. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 50, 40], 
 [52, 51, 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, '_', 51, 70, 49]]

8. Swap '_' with 50. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, '_', 40], 
 [52, 51, 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, 49]]

9. Swap '_' with 49. The grid becomes:
[[92, 90, 83, 49, 40], 
 [52, 51, 31, 70, 16], 
 [36, 56, 51, 70, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [92, 90, 83, 70, 56, 52, 51, 50, 49].

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[60, 66, 46, 8, 36], 
 [81, '_', 88, 70, 24], 
 [20, 17, 6, 62, 28]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[88, 81, 70, 66, 62], 
 [60, 46, 36, 28, 24], 
 [20, 17, 8, 6, '_']]

To reach the goal state from the initial state, we can follow these steps:

1. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 88. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[60, 66, 46, 8, 36], 
 [81, 88, '_', 70, 24], 
 [20, 17, 6, 62, 28]]

2. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 70. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[60, 66, 46, 8, 36], 
 [81, 88, 70, '_', 24], 
 [20, 17, 6, 62, 28]]

3. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 24. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[60, 66, 46, 8, 36], 
 [81, 88, 70, 24, '_'], 
 [20, 17, 6, 62, 28]]

4. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 28. The state of the puzzle becomes:

[[60, 66, 46, 8, 36], 
 [81, 88, 70, 24, 28], 
 [20, 17, 6, 62, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [88, 70, 24, 28].

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[85, 96, 29, 80, 12], 
 [60, '_', 76, 42, 82], 
 [27, 89, 72, 37, 55]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

 [76, 72, 60, 55, 42], 
 [37, 29, 27, 12, '_']]

We can start by swapping the empty spot with the largest number that is not in its correct position. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

The sequence of swaps is as follows:

1. Swap '_' with 96. The grid becomes:

[[85, '_', 29, 80, 12], 
 [60, 96, 76, 42, 82], 
 [27, 89, 72, 37, 55]]

 [60, '_', 76, 42, 82], 
 [27, 96, 72, 37, 55]]

3. Swap '_' with 85. The grid becomes:

[['_', 89, 29, 80, 12], 
 [60, 85, 76, 42, 82], 
 [27, 96, 72, 37, 55]]

4. Swap '_' with 82. The grid becomes:

[[82, 89, 29, '_', 12], 
 [60, 85, 76, 42, 80], 
 [27, 96, 72, 37, 55]]

5. Swap '_' with 80. The grid becomes:

[[82, 89, 29, 80, 12], 
 [60, 85, 76, 42, '_'], 
 [27, 96, 72, 37, 55]]

6. Swap '_' with 76. The grid becomes:

[[82, 89, 29, 80, 12], 
 [60, 85, '_', 42, 76], 
 [27, 96, 72, 37, 55]]

7. Swap '_' with 72. The grid becomes:

 [60, 85, 72, 42, 76], 
 [27, 96, '_', 37, 55]]

8. Swap '_' with 60. The grid becomes:

[[82, 89, 29, 80, 12], 
 ['_', 85, 72, 42, 76], 
 [27, 96, 60, 37, 55]]

9. Swap '_' with 55. The grid becomes:

[[82, 89, 29, 80, 12], 
 [55, 85, 72, 42, 76], 
 [27, 96, 60, 37, '_']]

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [96, 89, 85, 82, 80, 76, 72, 60, 55].

To achieve the goal state, we need to swap the empty spot with the following tiles in order:

1. Swap '_' with 82: Move the empty spot to the right by swapping it with 82.
2. Swap '_' with 72: Move the empty spot up by swapping it with 72.
3. Swap '_' with 83: Move the empty spot to the left by swapping it with 83.
4. Swap '_' with 88: Move the empty spot to the left by swapping it with 88.
5. Swap '_' with 98: Move the empty spot up by swapping it with 98.

So, the shortest list of tiles that need to be swapped with the empty spot to achieve the goal state is [82, 72, 83, 88, 98].

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is: 

[[71, 36, 63, 32, 15], 
 [20, 21, 65, '_', 54], 
 [45, 96, 29, 31, 55]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

 [54, 45, 36, 32, 31], 
 [29, 21, 20, 15, '_']]

To reach the goal state from the initial state, we can follow these steps:

1. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 65. This will move the tile numbered 65 to its correct position.
2. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 96. This will move the tile numbered 96 to its correct position.
3. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 71. This will move the tile numbered 71 to its correct position.
4. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 36. This will move the tile numbered 36 to its correct position.
5. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 45. This will move the tile numbered 45 to its correct position.
6. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 54. This will move the tile numbered 54 to its correct position.
7. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 55. This will move the tile numbered 55 to its correct position.
8. Swap the empty spot with the tile numbered 63. This will move the tile numbered 63 to its correct position.

We can start by moving the largest number, 96, to the top left corner. This can be done by swapping the empty spot with 96. Then, we can move the second largest number, 88, to the second spot in the first row. This can be done by swapping the empty spot with 88. We continue this process until we reach the goal state. 

The sequence of tile swaps is: 96, 88, 84, 80, 79, 74, 72, 71, 59, 51, 28, 25, 24, 19.

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of tile swaps that will result in the goal state. The goal state is a grid where all tiles are in descending order, with the largest number in the top left corner, and the empty spot is in the bottom right corner. 

The initial state of the puzzle is:

[[89, 88, 62, 57, 79, 53], 
 [92, 48, 61, 67, 78, 14], 
 [32, 63, 27, '_', 19, 54]]

The goal state of the puzzle is:

[[92, 89, 88, 79, 78, 67], 
 [63, 62, 61, 57, 54, 53], 
 [48, 32, 27, 19, 14, '_']]

We can see that the empty spot needs to be moved to the bottom right corner, and the tiles need to be rearranged in descending order. 

The shortest sequence of tile swaps to achieve the goal state is:

1. Swap the empty spot with 27
2. Swap the empty spot with 63
3. Swap the empty spot with 32
4. Swap the empty spot with 92
5. Swap the empty spot with 89
6. Swap the empty spot with 88
7. Swap the empty spot with 79
8. Swap the empty spot with 78
9. Swap the empty spot with 67
10. Swap the empty spot with 62
11. Swap the empty spot with 61
12. Swap the empty spot with 57
13. Swap the empty spot with 54
14. Swap the empty spot with 53
15. Swap the empty spot with 48
16. Swap the empty spot with 32
17. Swap the empty spot with 27
18. Swap the empty spot with 19
19. Swap the empty spot with 14
