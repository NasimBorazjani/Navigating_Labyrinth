{'difficulty': 4, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 6 stacks each with a capacity of 4 blocks, with 3 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the current configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the stack. The algorithm continues to generate new states until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to a stack that is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm finds the optimal solution.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions, which include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the states that have not been visited yet, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost so far and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal. The estimated cost is calculated using a heuristic function, which simulates moving the top block of each stack to a stack that is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade. The algorithm continues exploring states until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is then the sequence of actions that led to the goal state.

In this problem, the states are represented as a graph where each node is a state of the stacks and each edge is an action that transforms one state into another. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm repeatedly pops the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all possible actions from that state, and adds the resulting states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it pops the goal state from the queue. The heuristic function used in this problem is a constant function that always returns 0, as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state.

The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that is widely used in computer science and AI. It uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal, and it explores a graph by visiting the nodes in the order of their heuristic scores (the estimated cost to reach the goal) plus the cost to reach the nodes from the initial node, thus ensuring that the first solution found is the optimal solution.

In this problem, the initial state of the stacks is given and the goal state is when all the blocks are sorted by shade. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The cost of each action (moving a block from one stack to another) is given by the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The heuristic function is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, checks if the new state is the goal state, and if not, adds the new state to the queue of states to be visited. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or has visited all possible states. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses a priority queue to explore the nodes with the lowest total cost first. The algorithm continues to explore nodes until it reaches the goal node, at which point it returns the path from the start node to the goal node. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the stacks, the edges are the actions of moving a block from one stack to another, and the cost of an edge is the cost of moving a block to a stack. The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade.

In this problem, we are given the initial state of the stacks and the goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The cost of moving a block to each stack is given. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The goal is to find the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. 

The A* search algorithm is used to solve this problem. The algorithm maintains a queue of states to be visited, with each state represented as a tuple of stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state and explores all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving a block from the top of any stack to any other stack. The cost of each state is the cost of moving a block to the stack. The algorithm continues to explore states until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is then the list of actions taken to reach the goal state. The heuristic function used in the algorithm is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state.

It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal, which helps in providing an optimal solution. The heuristic function used here is the sum of the costs of moving the blocks in the stacks to the stack with the lowest cost.

In this problem, the goal state is not predefined and we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. Therefore, the heuristic is 0. The A* algorithm then reduces to Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a special case of A* when the heuristic is 0.

The solution to the problem is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The solution is generated by implementing the A* search algorithm, which is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node. The algorithm maintains a tree of paths originating at the start node and extends those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied. At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes the sum of the cost of the path and the cost to reach the goal, which is computed by a heuristic function. The heuristic function used in this solution is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

In this problem, the initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the blocks in it. The blocks are represented as strings. The goal state is when all the blocks are sorted by shade, ie each stack is either empty or contains blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the dictionary stack_costs. The A* search algorithm is implemented to find the sequence of actions with the least cost to reach the goal state from the initial state. The heuristic is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

In this problem, we are given the initial state of the stacks and the goal is to sort the blocks by shade. The cost of moving a block to each stack is given. We are to find the sequence of moves that results in the blocks being sorted with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states, where each state represents the current configuration of the stacks. The priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from that state. The algorithm repeatedly selects the state with the lowest priority, generates all possible successor states by moving a block from one stack to another, and updates their cost and priority. The algorithm terminates when it selects the goal state. The heuristic function used in this problem is a constant function that always returns 0, as we do not have any information on the goal state.

In this problem, the states are represented as a graph where each node is a state of the stacks and each edge is an action that transforms one state into another. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal. The algorithm repeatedly pops the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all possible actions from that state, and adds the resulting states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it pops the goal state from the queue, and returns the actions that were taken to reach the goal state. The heuristic function used in this problem is a constant function that always returns 0, because the cost of the goal state is not known.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, and always selects the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible because it is greedy, always opting for the action that sorts the blocks the most, ensuring it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a block is moved to a stack with a different shade, or equal or less by at most the cost of moving a block to the stack (equal to the cost of reaching the successor node, ie one action) as the maximum amount of blocks that can be sorted is by moving the block to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade, which is exactly the action taken in the heuristic. Thus h(n) can never be greater than c(n, n’)(equal to the cost of moving a block to the stack) + h(n’).

{'difficulty': 4, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 6 stacks each with a capacity of 4 blocks, with 3 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the least cost path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from a given state, and always expands the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to the goal. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the remaining blocks to the stacks with the lowest cost. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality and completeness of the A* search algorithm. The states are represented as 2d tuples, with each tuple representing a stack and each element in the tuple representing a block in the stack. The actions are represented as tuples, with the first element being the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the second element being the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The goal state is when all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

In this problem, the state of the problem is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the order of the blocks in the stack. The initial state is given in the problem statement. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The possible actions from a state include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, provided the stack is not full and if the stack is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. The cost of an action is the cost of moving a block to the stack, given in the problem statement. The heuristic is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The A* search algorithm is used to find the sequence of actions with the least cost that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted.

In the above code, we first define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimate remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. 

While there are un-visited states, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach the goal state. 

We then generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. 

The heuristic function is a simulation of moving the top block from each stack to the stack with the lowest cost, if the stack is not full and the block can be moved to the stack. This heuristic is admissible because it is greedy, always opting for the action that costs the least, ensuring it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a block is moved to a stack with a higher cost, or equal or less by at most the cost of moving a block to the stack with the lowest cost.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions, which include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm uses a priority queue to select the next state to explore based on the sum of the cost so far and an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The estimate is calculated using a heuristic function, which is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to another stack, if the stack is not sorted. The algorithm continues exploring states until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain 3 blocks of the same shade, which is the goal state. The solution is the sequence of actions that leads to the goal state with the least cost.

The solution to the problem is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The solution is generated by implementing the A* search algorithm, which is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node (out of one or more possible goals). It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node and uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited state and only explores a new state if it has not been visited or if a lower cost path to it is found. The algorithm stops when it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, and returns the actions taken to reach this state.

{'difficulty': 4, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 6 stacks each with a capacity of 4 blocks, with 3 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, and a cost function to keep track of the cost to reach the current state from the initial state. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states, where the priority of a state is the sum of its cost and heuristic. The algorithm repeatedly dequeues the state with the lowest priority, and generates all possible successors of this state by applying all valid actions. If a successor state is the goal state, the algorithm returns the actions taken to reach this state. If not, and the successor state is either unvisited or the new path to this state is cheaper than the previously found path, the algorithm enqueues the successor state with its new cost and heuristic. The algorithm continues this process until the goal state is dequeued, at which point the actions taken to reach the goal state are returned. If the queue is empty and the goal state has not been dequeued, the algorithm returns None, indicating that there is no solution. The heuristic used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a stack that is either empty or has blocks of the same shade as the top block of the current stack, with the lowest cost of moving a block to it. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that A* search algorithm is optimal and complete.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions, which include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first. The heuristic function used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the A* search algorithm. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions, which include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. It then checks if the new state is valid, i.e., if the stack is not full and if the stack is either empty or the top block is of the same shade as the block to be moved. If the new state is valid, it calculates the cost of the new state, which is the cost of moving a block to the to_stack. The algorithm then checks if the new state has been visited before or if the new cost is less than the cost of the previously visited state. If it is, it updates the cost of the new state and adds it to the queue. The algorithm continues this process until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the algorithm finds the shortest path to the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 7, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 9, 5: 4, 6: 2, 7: 7}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred, indexing from 0.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a weighted graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to visit. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and updates this cost if it finds a shorter path. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal node. In this problem, the nodes are the states of the stacks, the edges are the actions of moving a block from one stack to another, and the weights are the costs of these actions. The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, which ensures that the A* search algorithm finds the shortest path.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple represent the blocks in the stack. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The possible actions from a state include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, provided the destination stack is not full and is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. The cost of moving a block is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The heuristic is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm keeps track of the visited states and their costs, and uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first. The algorithm returns the actions taken to reach the goal state when it is found.

The above code will return the list of tuples representing the moves to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses this estimate to prioritize the nodes to explore. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited node and uses a priority queue to determine the next node to explore. The priority of a node in the queue is the sum of the cost to reach that node and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that node. The algorithm continues exploring nodes until it reaches the goal node, at which point it returns the path to the goal. In this problem, the states of the problem are represented as a graph, where each node is a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible action to move a block from one stack to another. The cost of an edge is the cost to move a block to the corresponding stack. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from a given state, and it is defined as the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a stack that is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, meaning that it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal and the estimated cost to reach the goal from a node is non-decreasing along a path. The algorithm returns a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first. The heuristic function used in the algorithm is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, which ensures that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is then returned as a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. The algorithm continues to explore the state space until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and a cost function to keep track of the cost to reach the current node from the start node. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority of a node is the sum of the cost to reach that node and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that node. The algorithm repeatedly dequeues the node with the highest priority, and enqueues its neighbors. The algorithm stops when it dequeues the goal node. The path from the start node to the goal node is then returned.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples. The cost of moving a block to each stack is also defined. The visited_costs dictionary is used to keep track of the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue is a priority queue that stores states that have not been visited yet. The priority of each state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from a given state. It calculates the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a stack that is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade. The algorithm continues to explore states until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. It then returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

In this problem, we are given the initial state of the stacks and the goal is to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states, where each state represents the current configuration of the stacks. The priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from that state. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the costs of the actions taken to reach that state from the initial state, and the estimated cost to reach the goal state is calculated using a heuristic function. In this problem, the heuristic function always returns 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm repeatedly removes the state with the lowest priority from the queue and expands it, generating all possible successor states and adding them to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it removes the goal state from the queue, and returns the actions taken to reach the goal state from the initial state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, and it uses a priority queue to explore the nodes with the lowest total cost first. The algorithm continues to explore nodes until it reaches the goal node, at which point it returns the path to the goal.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the least cost path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple represent the blocks in the stack. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the dictionary stack_costs. The visited_costs dictionary is used to store the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue is a priority queue that stores states that have not been visited yet, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost to reach that state and the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal state from that state. The heuristic function is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from each stack to any other stack, and checks if the new state is valid, i.e., if the stack is not full and if the stack is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. If the new state is valid, it is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

In the above code, we first define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. 

While there are unvisited states, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. We then check if the current state is the goal state, i.e., all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. If it is, we return the actions taken to reach this state. 

If the current state is not the goal state, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. We check if the stack is not empty and if the stack is either empty or the top block is of the same shade as the block to be moved. If these conditions are met, we generate the new state and calculate the cost of the new state, which is the cost of moving a block to the to_stack. 

If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic is the sum of the costs of moving the remaining blocks in the stacks to the cheapest stack. 

Finally, we define the heuristic function, which is a simulation of moving all the remaining blocks to the cheapest stack. This heuristic is admissible because it is greedy, always opting for the action that costs the least, ensuring it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a block is moved to a more expensive stack, or equal or less by at most the cost of moving a block to the cheapest stack.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where each state is a tuple representing the current configuration of the stacks. The priority of each state in the queue is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from that state. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the costs of the actions taken to reach that state, and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from a state is calculated using a heuristic function. The heuristic function used here is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm finds the optimal solution. The algorithm continues to explore states until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, at which point it returns the actions taken to reach that state.

In this problem, the states are represented as a graph where each node is a state of the stacks and each edge is an action of moving a block from one stack to another. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost from the current state to the goal state, which helps to prioritize the nodes to explore. The heuristic function is admissible and consistent, which ensures that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others.

In the above code, we first define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. 

In the main loop, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach it. Otherwise, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. For each action, we generate the new state and calculate the cost of reaching it. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states.

The heuristic function calculates the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack. This heuristic is admissible because it assumes we can move the blocks to any stack, thus reporting a lower cost estimate to reach the goal state. It is also consistent because the cost of moving a block from one stack to another is always greater than or equal to the cost of moving the block to an empty stack.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and uses a priority queue to select the next state to visit based on the sum of the cost so far and the estimated remaining cost (heuristic) to reach the goal state. The heuristic function used is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The solution is then returned as a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the blocks in it. The cost of moving a block to each stack is stored in a dictionary. The visited_costs dictionary stores the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue stores states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimate remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. The algorithm then iterates through the queue, popping the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal. It checks if the current state is the goal state, and if so, returns the actions taken to reach it. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. It checks if the action is valid, generates the new state, calculates the new cost, and adds the new state to the queue if it has not been visited or if the new cost is lower than the previously recorded cost. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or exhausts all possible states.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The state of the problem is represented as a 2D tuple, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple represent the blocks in the stack. The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a stack that is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade. The cost of a state is the cost of moving a block to the stack in that state. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The actions are represented as tuples of the index of the stack from which a block is moved and the index of the stack to which it is moved. The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the states to be visited, where the priority of a state is the sum of its cost and heuristic value. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or there are no more states to visit. The solution is the list of actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others.

In the above code, we first define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. 

While there are unvisited states, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach it. 

We then generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. 

The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a new stack. This heuristic is admissible because it presumes we can move the blocks to any stack, even if it is full or contains blocks of a different shade, thus reporting a lower cost estimate to reach the goal state. The heuristic is consistent, i.e., non-decreasing along the path to the goal state, because the cost of moving a block from one stack to another is the cost of moving a block to the stack, which is always greater than or equal to the cost of moving the block to the stack in the heuristic. Also, the cost of the goal state is 0, as there are no blocks to move in the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and generates all possible actions, which include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. It then checks if the new state is valid and if it has not been visited before or if the new cost is less than the visited cost. If so, it adds the new state to the queue. The algorithm continues this process until it finds the goal state, where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The heuristic function used in this problem is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to a new stack, using the minimum cost of moving a block to a stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality and efficiency of the A* search algorithm.

{'difficulty': 6, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 10 stacks each with a capacity of 6 blocks, with 5 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 5 blocks of a single shade.

In this problem, the initial state of the stacks is represented as a 2d tuple, where each tuple represents a stack and the order of the blocks in each stack is maintained. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The possible actions from any state include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, provided the stack to which the block is moved is either empty or the top block is of the same shade as the block to be moved, and the stack does not exceed its capacity. The cost of moving a block to a stack is given by the stack_costs dictionary. The heuristic function is 0 as we don't have any information on the goal state, other than the blocks must be sorted. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the current configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

{'difficulty': 6, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 10 stacks each with a capacity of 6 blocks, with 5 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 5 blocks of a single shade.

The solution to the problem is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The solution is generated by implementing the A* search algorithm, which is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node. The algorithm maintains a tree of paths originating at the start node and extends those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied. At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes the sum of the cost of the path and the cost to reach the goal, which is estimated by a heuristic function.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost so far to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal state. The cost of a state is the cost of moving a block to the stack in that state, and the heuristic function estimates the remaining cost by assuming that we can move the top block of each stack directly to its goal position. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all the blocks in each stack are of the same shade, and then returns the sequence of block transfers to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost so far to reach that state and an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The cost of a state is the cost of moving a block to the stack in that state, and the heuristic function estimates the remaining cost by summing the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, and adds the resulting new states to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all the blocks in each stack are of the same color, which is the goal state. The algorithm then returns the sequence of block transfers that led to the goal state.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the current configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that is known for its performance and accuracy. It works by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied. At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes the sum of the cost of the path and the cost to reach the goal, which is computed using a heuristic function.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the blocks in it. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the stack_costs dictionary. The visited_costs dictionary is used to store the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue is a priority queue that stores states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. The while loop continues until all states have been visited. In each iteration, the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal is popped from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, the actions taken to reach this state are returned. Otherwise, all possible actions from the current state are generated, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. If the new state is not visited or the new cost is less than the cost of reaching this state, the new state is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic function is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state.

In this problem, we are given a set of stacks with blocks of different shades. The goal is to sort the blocks such that each stack contains blocks of a single shade. We can only move the top block from a stack to another stack if the destination stack is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. The cost of moving a block to a stack is given. We are to find the sequence of moves that sorts the blocks with the least total cost.

The problem is modeled as a graph where each state is a node and each action (moving a block from one stack to another) is an edge. The cost of an edge is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from that state. The estimated cost is given by a heuristic function. In this problem, since we do not have any information on the goal state, we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state, thus the heuristic is 0. The algorithm iteratively pops the state with the lowest priority from the queue, generates all possible actions from the current state, and pushes the new states to the queue. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, and returns the sequence of actions taken to reach that state.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of states to visit, where the priority of a state is the sum of the cost so far to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal state. The cost of a state is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack, and the heuristic is the sum of the costs of moving the top block from each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same color. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from each stack to any other stack, and adds the new states to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, and returns the sequence of block transfers to reach that state.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 2, 1: 7, 2: 5, 3: 11, 4: 6, 5: 13, 6: 12, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 6, 10: 7, 11: 7}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the least cost sequence of block transfers to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined and the costs of moving a block to each stack are given. The visited_costs dictionary stores the least cost found so far to reach each visited state. The queue stores states not yet visited, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost so far and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal state. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by summing the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack, as the blocks must be moved at least once to sort the stacks. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, and checks if the action results in a valid state. If the new state is unvisited or a lower cost path to the state is found, it is added to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state, and returns the sequence of block transfers to reach this state.

```

In the above code, we first define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. We then initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. 

In the main loop, we pop the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach it. Otherwise, we generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. We check if the action is valid, i.e., if the stack is not full and if the stack is either empty or the top block is of the same shade as the block to be moved. If the action is valid, we generate the new state and calculate the cost of reaching it. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states.

The heuristic function is the sum of the costs of moving the top block of each stack to an empty stack or a stack with blocks of the same shade. This heuristic is admissible because it is greedy, always opting for the action that sorts the blocks the most, ensuring it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a block is moved to a stack with a different shade, or equal or less by at most the cost of moving a block to the stack.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 12, 1: 11, 2: 5, 3: 11, 4: 10, 5: 9, 6: 5, 7: 5, 8: 3, 9: 10, 10: 5, 11: 5}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

In this problem, the state of the problem is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple are the blocks in the stack. The blocks are represented as strings. The initial state of the problem is given. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The actions that can be taken in each state include moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, provided the stack is not full and the stack is either empty or the top block is of the same shade as the block to be moved. The cost of an action is the cost of moving a block to the stack where the block is moved. The heuristic function is 0 as we don't have any information about the goal state that can be used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The solution to the problem is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is moved and the index of the stack to which it is moved.

   # The heuristic is consistent as the estimated cost of the next node is higher if a block is moved from a stack, or equal or less by at most the cost of moving a block to the stack with the lowest cost (equal to the cost of reaching the successor node, ie one action) as the maximum number of blocks that can be moved to a stack is the capacity of the stack, which is exactly the number of blocks moved to the stack in the heuristic. Thus h(n) can never be greater than c(n, n’)(equal to the cost of moving a block to the stack with the lowest cost) + h(n’)
   h = 0
   # Get the cost of moving a block to the stack with the lowest cost
   min_stack_cost = min(stack_costs.values())
   # Add the cost of moving all the remaining blocks to the stack with the lowest cost to the heuristic
   for stack in state:
       h += len(stack) * min_stack_cost
   return h

The solution to the problem is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The solution is generated by implementing the A* search algorithm, which is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node (out of one or more possible goals). It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node and uses this heuristic to prioritize the nodes to be explored. The heuristic function is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each visited state and only explores a new state if it has not been visited or if a lower cost path to it is found. The algorithm terminates when it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, and returns the actions taken to reach this state.

In this problem, we are given a set of stacks with blocks of different shades. The goal is to sort the blocks such that each stack contains blocks of only one shade. The cost of moving a block from one stack to another is given. We are to find the sequence of moves that results in the sorted stacks with the least total cost. 

The problem is solved using the A* search algorithm. The initial state of the stacks is defined and the cost of moving a block to each stack is given. The visited_costs dictionary is initialized to keep track of the least cost to reach each visited state. The priority queue is initialized with the initial state and its cost. 

The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest cost from the queue. If the state is the goal state (all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of only one shade), it returns the sequence of moves to reach this state. Otherwise, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. It checks if the action is valid (the stack is not full and if the stack is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved) and generates the new state. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, it adds it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. 

The heuristic function is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, other than that the blocks in each stack must be of the same shade. 

The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or has visited all possible states. If it finds the goal state, it returns the sequence of moves to reach this state. If it has visited all possible states and has not found the goal state, it returns None, indicating that there is no solution.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the blocks in it. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the stack_costs dictionary. The visited_costs dictionary is used to store the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue is a priority queue that stores states not yet visited, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimated remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. The while loop continues until all states have been visited. In each iteration, the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal is popped from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, the actions taken to reach the goal state are returned. Otherwise, all possible actions from the current state are generated, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. If the new state is not visited or the new cost is less than the cost of the previously visited same state, the new state is added to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic function is 0 as we don't have any information about the goal state, other than the constraints on the blocks in each stack.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple are the blocks in the stack. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the stack_costs dictionary. The visited_costs dictionary is used to store the cost of reaching each visited state. The queue is a priority queue that stores states that have not been visited yet, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost to reach that state and the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal state from that state. The heuristic function is 0 as we don't have any information about the goal state, other than the constraints on the blocks in each stack. The algorithm generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack, and checks if the action results in a valid state. If the new state is valid and has not been visited before or has a lower cost than the previously visited same state, it is added to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state that satisfies the goal condition, which is that all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The solution is the sequence of actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 8, 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 12, 4: 9, 5: 9, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 11, 9: 9, 10: 3, 11: 2}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a 2D tuple. The number of stacks and the capacity of each stack are also defined. The cost of moving a block to each stack is given in a dictionary. 

We initialize a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue to store the states not yet visited. The priority of each state in the queue is the sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal state. 

In the while loop, we pop the state with the lowest priority from the queue. If the state is the goal state, we return the actions taken to reach this state. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. 

We then generate all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. We check if the stack is not empty and if the stack is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade as the block to be moved. If these conditions are met, we generate the new state and calculate the cost of the new state. 

If the new state is not visited or we found a new path with a lower cost to reach this state, we add it to the queue of not-yet-visited states. The heuristic is 0 as we do not have any information on the goal state, thus we cannot estimate the cost to reach the goal state. 

Finally, we print the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 11, 1: 13, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 13, 5: 7, 6: 12, 7: 6, 8: 4, 9: 6, 10: 11, 11: 4}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined and the cost of moving a block to each stack is also defined. The visited_costs dictionary is used to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each state. The queue is a priority queue where the priority of each state is the sum of the cost so far and the heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The heuristic is 0 as we don't have an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem. The algorithm then enters a loop where it keeps popping the state with the lowest priority from the queue and generating all possible actions from the current state. An action is valid if it doesn't violate the constraints of the problem. If a new state is generated, it is added to the queue with its cost and actions. The loop continues until the queue is empty or the goal state is reached. The goal state is reached when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The actions taken to reach the goal state are then returned.

In this problem, we are given the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The goal is to find the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. 

The A* search algorithm is used to solve this problem. The algorithm maintains a queue of states to be visited, sorted by the sum of the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm starts with the initial state and explores all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. The cost of the new state is the cost of moving a block to the to_stack. If the new state has not been visited before or if the new cost is less than the cost of the previously visited same state, the new state is added to the queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all the stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, which is the goal state. The algorithm then returns the actions that led to the goal state. 

The heuristic function used in this problem is 0 as we don't have any information on the goal state, thus we can't estimate the cost to reach the goal state.

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The initial state of the stacks is defined as a 2D tuple, where each tuple represents a stack and the elements in the tuple represent the blocks in the stack. The goal state is when all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving a block to each stack is defined in the stack_costs dictionary.

The algorithm starts by initializing the visited_costs dictionary, which stores the cost of reaching each visited state, and the queue, which stores the states not yet visited. The queue is a priority queue, where the priority of each state is the sum of the cost to reach that state and the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal state.

The algorithm then enters a loop, where it pops the state with the lowest priority from the queue. If the state is the goal state, it returns the actions taken to reach the goal state. Otherwise, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving the top block from any stack to any other stack. For each action, it checks if the action is valid, generates the new state, calculates the cost of the new state, and adds the new state to the queue if it has not been visited or if the new cost is lower than the previously recorded cost.

The heuristic function is 0 as we do not have any information about the goal state, other than the constraints on the blocks in each stack. Therefore, the priority of each state is simply the cost to reach that state.

The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or exhausts all possible states. If it finds the goal state, it returns the actions taken to reach the goal state. If it exhausts all possible states, it returns None, indicating that there is no solution.
