It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node. Thus h(s) is always less than or equal to c(s, n)(equal to 1) + h(n).

In this problem, we are using the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state. It counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks by shade. The heuristic function is the count of blocks that are not the same shade as the most frequent shade in their stack. The cost function is the cost of moving a block to a stack. The algorithm keeps track of the visited states and their costs, and uses a priority queue to explore the states with the lowest cost first. The algorithm stops when it finds a state where each stack only contains blocks of a single shade.

In this code, we use the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state. It counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space in a way that prioritizes states that are estimated to be closer to the goal state. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, and is designed to never overestimate this cost to ensure the optimality of the solution.

This code will return the shortest sequence of moves to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which helps to prioritize the states to explore. The heuristic function is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

This code will return the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is a configuration of blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node.

This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, and it's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic used here is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is both admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from a node to the goal is not more than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

This code uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which helps to prioritize the states to explore. The heuristic function counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is a lower bound on the number of moves required to reach the goal state. The algorithm keeps track of the cost to reach each visited state and only updates the cost if a lower cost path is found. The algorithm stops when it finds a state where each stack only contains blocks of a single color, which is the goal state. The solution is then returned as a list of tuples representing the moves made to reach the goal state.

The goal state is where each stack only contains blocks of 1 single shade. The code generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving a block from any of the 6 stacks to another stack. It checks if the new state would be valid, i.e., from_stack and to_stack must not be the same stack, and from_stack must at least have 1 block to move and the to_stack cannot be at capacity. If the new state is unvisited or we found a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state, it adds it to the queue of un-visited states. The code continues this process until it finds the goal state or there are no more unvisited states.

The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 7, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 9, 5: 4, 6: 2, 7: 7}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred, indexing from 0. Given the initial state of the stacks, represented by the lists below (with the leftmost item being the shade of the topmost block in each stack)(and the first stack being the stack at index 0), what is the list of transfer pairs (reported in python syntax) with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted?

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost of a node is never greater than the cost of reaching a successor node plus the estimated cost of the successor node), ensuring the optimality of the A* algorithm.

This code will return the shortest sequence of moves to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which helps to prioritize the states to explore. The heuristic function used here is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, which ensures that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost) and consistent (the estimated cost of a node is not more than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal). The algorithm returns the sequence of actions (pairs of stack indices) that results in the least cost to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

This solution uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks. The heuristic function is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node. Thus h(s) is always less than or equal to c(s, n)(equal to 1) + h(n).

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or has explored all possible states. The solution is a list of tuples representing the actions taken to reach the goal state.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken to reach it. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state and checks if the new state is valid. If the new state is unvisited or has a lower cost than a previously visited state, it is added to the queue. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The process continues until the goal state is reached or there are no more unvisited states. The final result is a list of tuples representing the actions taken to reach the goal state.

The above code will return the shortest sequence of actions needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This solution uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once.

Thus h(s) is always less than or equal to c(s, n)(equal to 1) + h(n).

In this problem, the A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions, which include moving a block from any stack to another stack. The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the states that have not been visited yet, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal. The estimated remaining cost is calculated using a heuristic function, which counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm continues exploring states until it finds a state where each stack only contains blocks of a single color, which is the goal state. The solution is then the list of actions taken to reach the goal state.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken to reach it. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state and checks if the new state would be valid. If the new state is valid, it generates the new state, calculates the new cost, and checks if the new state is unvisited or if a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state has been found. If so, it adds the new state to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, and it's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1.

The above code will return the shortest sequence of actions needed to sort the blocks by shade in the stacks. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving a block from any of the 8 stacks to another stack. It checks if the new state would be valid and if so, generates the new state and calculates the new cost. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state is found, it adds it to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or exhausts all possible states.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state and checks if the new state is valid. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state is found, it adds it to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

In this problem, the A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path to sort the blocks in the stacks. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The cost of each action is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm keeps track of the visited states and their costs, and always selects the state with the lowest total cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) to explore next. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal state and returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 9, 3: 8, 4: 3, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: 5}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. If the current state is the goal state, it returns the actions taken to reach it. Otherwise, it generates all possible actions from the current state and checks if the new state is valid. If the new state is unvisited or has a lower cost than a previously visited state, it adds it to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function counts the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or exhausts all possible states.

The above code will return the list of tuples representing the moves to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the states with the lowest cost first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality and efficiency of the A* search.

This code will return the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, ensuring the optimality of the solution.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal state or has explored all possible states. The solution is a list of tuples representing the actions (from_stack, to_stack) taken to reach the goal state.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem and using a heuristic function to guide the search. The heuristic function used here is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken to reach it. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state and checks if the new state is valid. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to reach it is found, it is added to the queue of unvisited states. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The function returns a list of tuples representing the actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 6, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 10 stacks each with a capacity of 6 blocks, with 5 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 5 blocks of a single shade.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all blocks sorted by shade). The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same shade as the most frequent shade in their stack. The algorithm uses a priority queue to always explore the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and the estimated remaining cost. The algorithm stops when it reaches the goal state and returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state is a configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is an admissible and consistent heuristic for this problem.

{'difficulty': 6, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 10 stacks each with a capacity of 6 blocks, with 5 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 5 blocks of a single shade.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. It starts by defining the initial state of the stacks and other variables. It then initializes a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each visited state and a priority queue of states not yet visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it pops the state with the lowest sum of the cost so far and estimated cost to the goal from the queue. It checks if the current state is the goal state and if so, returns the actions taken. If not, it generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving a block from any of the 10 stacks to another stack. It checks if the new state would be valid and if so, generates the new state and calculates the new cost. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state is found, it adds it to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This code will return the shortest sequence of moves to sort the blocks in the stacks. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution. The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal state from the current state, which helps to prioritize the states to explore. The heuristic function used here is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible and consistent, which ensures that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal solution.

The above code will return the shortest sequence of block transfers that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible states by moving blocks from one stack to another. The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (the cost to reach the state plus the estimated cost to reach the goal) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is never greater than the cost from the current state to a successor state plus the estimated cost from the successor state to the goal). The algorithm stops when it reaches a state where all stacks only contain blocks of a single color, and returns the actions taken to reach this state.

This code will return the list of tuples representing the moves needed to sort the blocks in the stacks with the least possible cost. The A* search algorithm is used to find the optimal solution by exploring the state space of the problem, where each state represents the configuration of the blocks in the stacks. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state from a given state, which helps to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic used here is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack, which is both admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and consistent (the estimated cost from a node to the goal is not more than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal).

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 12, 1: 11, 2: 5, 3: 11, 4: 10, 5: 9, 6: 5, 7: 5, 8: 3, 9: 10, 10: 5, 11: 5}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred, indexing from 0.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks are sorted by color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (actual cost to reach the state + estimated cost to reach the goal) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost) and consistent (the estimated cost from the current state to the goal is not greater than the cost from the current state to a successor state plus the estimated cost from the successor state to the goal), ensuring the optimality of the solution.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 7, 1: 13, 2: 10, 3: 12, 4: 4, 5: 13, 6: 2, 7: 11, 8: 11, 9: 10, 10: 8, 11: 9}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single shade). The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the states that have not been visited yet, with the priority of each state being the sum of the cost to reach that state and the estimated remaining cost to reach the goal state. The cost to reach a state is the sum of the costs of moving blocks to reach that state, and the estimated remaining cost is calculated using a heuristic function. The heuristic function used in this problem is the count of blocks that are not the same shade as the most frequent shade in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, and it is consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1. The algorithm continues exploring states until it reaches the goal state, at which point it returns the actions taken to reach the goal state.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

The above code will solve the problem by implementing the A* search algorithm. The algorithm starts with the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible actions (moving a block from one stack to another) to reach the goal state (all stacks contain blocks of a single color). The priority queue ensures that the states with the lowest cost (cost so far + estimated remaining cost) are explored first. The heuristic function estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal state by counting the number of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost) and consistent (the estimated cost of a node is not more than the cost from the current node to a successor node plus the estimated cost from the successor node to the goal). The algorithm returns the sequence of actions (pairs of stack indices) that results in the least cost to sort the blocks.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 11, 1: 13, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 13, 5: 7, 6: 12, 7: 6, 8: 4, 9: 6, 10: 11, 11: 4}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred, indexing from 0. Given the initial state of the stacks, represented by the lists below (with the leftmost item being the shade of the topmost block in each stack)(and the first stack being the stack at index 0), what is the list of transfer pairs (reported in python syntax) with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted?

The above code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The heuristic function is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade.

The above code uses the A* search algorithm to solve the problem. The initial state of the stacks is defined and other variables are encoded. A dictionary is initialized to store the cost of reaching each visited state. A priority queue of states not yet visited is initialized, with the initial state as the first element. The priority of each element is the cost to reach that state (g) + the estimate remaining cost (h) to reach the goal. The actions required to get to each state are recorded in a list. The algorithm then generates all possible actions from the current state, which includes moving a block from any of the 12 stacks to another stack. The new state is generated and the cost so far is the cost of moving a block to the to_stack. If the new state is unvisited or a new path with a lower cost to arrive at this state is found, it is added to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. The algorithm continues until all blocks are correctly sorted and returns the list of transfer pairs.

This solution uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to sort the blocks. The heuristic function used is the count of blocks that are not the same color as the most frequent color in their stack. This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, as each mismatched block must be moved at least once. It's consistent because moving a block from one stack to another reduces the heuristic cost of the successor node by a max of 1 (if the moved block's color matches the most common color in the new stack but not in the old one), which is equal to the cost of reaching the successor node. Thus h(s) is always less than or equal to c(s, n)(equal to 1) + h(n).
