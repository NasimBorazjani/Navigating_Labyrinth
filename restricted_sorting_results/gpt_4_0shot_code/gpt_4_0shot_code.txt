{'difficulty': 4, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 6 stacks each with a capacity of 4 blocks, with 3 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the stacks can be considered as a node in the graph. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state of the stacks and explores all possible states by moving one block at a time. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of moving blocks and always chooses the move with the least cost. The algorithm stops when it reaches a state where all the blocks are correctly sorted.

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve this problem:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def is_sorted(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

def get_moves(stacks):
    moves = []
    for i in range(6):
        if stacks[i]:
            for j in range(6):
                if i != j and (not stacks[j] or stacks[j][-1] == stacks[i][-1]) and len(stacks[j]) < 4:
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

def bfs(stacks):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [])])
    visited = set([str(stacks)])
    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()
        if is_sorted(current):
            return path
        for move in get_moves(current):
            next_state = deepcopy(current)
            next_state[move[1]].append(next_state[move[0]].pop())
            if str(next_state) not in visited:
                visited.add(str(next_state))
                queue.append((next_state, path + [move]))
    return []

stacks = [[], [], [], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Red', 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Green'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Green']]
print(bfs(stacks))
```

This script first checks if the current state of the stacks is sorted. If it is, it returns the path to this state. If it is not, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the queue. The script continues this process until it finds a sorted state or the queue is empty. If the queue is empty, it means that there is no solution to the problem.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the block transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible block transfers. It keeps track of the total cost of the block transfers and the sequence of block transfers.

4. The BFS algorithm uses a priority queue to select the next state to explore. The priority queue is ordered by the total cost of the block transfers, so the state with the lowest total cost is always selected first.

5. The BFS algorithm stops when it finds the goal state. The sequence of block transfers that leads to the goal state is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements the BFS algorithm to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    visited = set()

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

2. Create a queue and add the root node to it.
3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue. If this node represents a state where all stacks are sorted, return the path from the root to this node. Otherwise, for each possible block transfer, create a new node, add it to the queue, and add an edge from the current node to the new node.

This script uses a breadth-first search to find the shortest path to a state where all stacks are sorted. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next, and a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. For each node, it generates all possible next states by moving a block from one stack to another, and adds these to the queue. It continues this process until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted, or until it has visited all possible states.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible states by transferring one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade.

4. Keep track of the cost of each transfer and choose the path with the least cost.

5. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

Here is a python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(stacks, costs):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [])])
    visited = set()

```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The `bfs` function takes the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack as input and returns the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost. The `is_goal` function checks if a state is a goal state. The `get_moves` function generates all possible moves from a state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. 

In this problem, each state of the stacks can be considered as a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes represent the possible moves from one state to another. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible moves. It keeps track of the cost of each move and the path taken to reach each state. The algorithm stops when it finds a state where all the stacks are sorted according to the rules.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def is_sorted(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

def get_moves(stacks):
    moves = []
    for i in range(len(stacks)):
        if stacks[i]:
            for j in range(len(stacks)):
                if i != j and (not stacks[j] or stacks[j][-1] == stacks[i][-1]) and len(stacks[j]) < 4:
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

def bfs(stacks):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        stacks, path, cost = queue.popleft()
        if str(stacks) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(str(stacks))
        if is_sorted(stacks):
            return path
        for move in get_moves(stacks):
            new_stacks = deepcopy(stacks)
            new_stacks[move[1]].append(new_stacks[move[0]].pop())
            new_cost = cost + {0: 5, 1: 3, 2: 5, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 7}[move[1]]
            queue.append((new_stacks, path + [move], new_cost))
    return []

stacks = [[], [], [], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Green'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']]
print(bfs(stacks))
```

This script first checks if the stacks are already sorted. If not, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the queue. It also keeps track of the path taken to reach each state and the total cost of the moves. The script continues this process until it finds a state where all the stacks are sorted. It then returns the path taken to reach this state. If no such state is found, it returns an empty list.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible states by transferring one block at a time. It keeps track of the minimum cost to reach each state.

4. Once the BFS algorithm reaches the goal state, it backtracks to find the path with the minimum cost.

5. The solution is the list of block transfers along this path.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

    # Define the goal state
    goal = [['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Green'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'], [], []]

    # Initialize the BFS queue and the visited set
    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        # Pop the current state, path and cost from the queue
        state, path, cost = queue.popleft()

        # If this state is the goal state, return the path
        if state == goal:
            return path

        # If this state has been visited before, skip it
        if str(state) in visited:
            continue

        # Mark this state as visited
        visited.add(str(state))

        # Explore all possible next states
        for i in range(6):
            for j in range(6):
                if i != j and state[i] and (not state[j] or state[i][-1] == state[j][-1]):
                    # Create a new state by transferring a block
                    new_state = [list(s) for s in state]
                    new_state[j].append(new_state[i].pop())
                    new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                    new_path = path + [(i, j)]

                    # Add the new state, path and cost to the queue
                    queue.append((new_state, new_path, new_cost))

    # If there is no solution, return an empty list
    return []

# Test the function
stacks = [['Blue', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Yellow'], [], [], [], ['Red', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Blue']]
costs = {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 1, 3: 7, 4: 2, 5: 3}
print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

Please note that this script assumes that the goal state is a state where all blocks are sorted by shade. If the goal state is different, you need to modify the `goal` variable accordingly.

TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible move. The weight of each edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all the blocks are correctly sorted.

3. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all the possible moves. It keeps track of the total cost of each move and the path taken to reach the current state.

4. The BFS algorithm uses a priority queue to select the next state to explore. The state with the lowest total cost is selected first.

5. The BFS algorithm stops when it finds the goal state. The path taken to reach the goal state is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements the above steps:

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

def bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs):
    queue = PriorityQueue()
    queue.put((0, initial_state, []))
    visited = set()
    while not queue.empty():
        cost, state, path = queue.get()
        if state == goal_state:
            return path
        if state in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(state)
        for next_state, move in possible_moves(state):
            next_cost = cost + costs[move[1]]
            queue.put((next_cost, next_state, path + [move]))
    return []

def possible_moves(state):
    moves = []
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(len(state)):
            if i != j and state[i] and (not state[j] or state[i][-1] == state[j][-1]):
                next_state = state[:]
                next_state[j] = next_state[j] + [next_state[i].pop()]
                moves.append((next_state, (i, j)))
    return moves

initial_state = [[], [], ['Green', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Green', 'Yellow'], []]
goal_state = [['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Green', 'Green'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'], [], []]
costs = {0: 1, 1: 7, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 6, 5: 5}

print(bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs))
```

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state, the goal state, and the costs as input and returns the path with the least possible cost. It also defines a helper function possible_moves that generates all possible moves from a given state. The script then calls the BFS function with the initial state, the goal state, and the costs to find the solution.

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'tuple'

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

The algorithm starts by initializing a queue with the initial state of the stacks. It then enters a loop where it dequeues a state from the queue, checks if it is the goal state (i.e., all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade), and if not, generates all possible successor states by moving a block from one stack to another according to the rules of the game. These successor states are then enqueued to be processed later. The algorithm continues this process until it finds the goal state or the queue is empty.

To keep track of the least cost path, we maintain a dictionary that maps each state to its predecessor state and the move that led to it. When we dequeue a state, we update this dictionary for each of its successor states. At the end, we can use this dictionary to backtrack from the goal state to the initial state and find the sequence of moves with the least cost.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def restricted_sorting(stacks):
    costs = {0: 3, 1: 5, 2: 1, 3: 6, 4: 7, 5: 4}
    initial_state = tuple(map(tuple, stacks))
    goal_state = ((), ('Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'), (), ('Green', 'Green', 'Green'), (), ('Red', 'Red', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'))

    predecessors = {initial_state: (None, None)}

                    new_state = list(map(list, state))
                    block = new_state[i].pop()
                    new_state[j].append(block)
                    new_state = tuple(map(tuple, new_state))
                    new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                    if new_state not in predecessors or new_cost < predecessors[new_state][1]:
                        predecessors[new_state] = (state, (i, j))
                        queue.append((new_state, new_cost, path + [(i, j)]))
    return None

stacks = [[], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red'], [], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'], [], ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow']]

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the corresponding block transfer.

2. Initialize the graph with the initial state of the stacks.

3. Perform a BFS on the graph, starting from the initial state. For each state, generate all possible next states by transferring a block from one stack to another, and add them to the BFS queue.

4. Keep track of the total cost of each state, and update it whenever a cheaper path to a state is found.

5. Stop the BFS when all blocks are correctly sorted. The state with the least total cost is the solution.

6. Trace back from the solution state to the initial state to get the list of block transfers.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def solve(stacks):
    costs = {tuple(map(tuple, stacks)): 0}
    prev = {tuple(map(tuple, stacks)): None}

                    continue

                new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
                new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())
                new_stacks = tuple(map(tuple, new_stacks))

                cost = costs[tuple(map(tuple, stacks))] + {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 7, 4: 1, 5: 7}[j]

                    prev[new_stacks] = (tuple(map(tuple, stacks)), i, j)
                    q.append(new_stacks)

    transfers = []

stacks = [['Green', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Green'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], [], [], ['Blue', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green'], []]

This script first initializes the costs and prev dictionaries with the initial state of the stacks. It then starts a BFS with the initial state. For each state, it generates all possible next states by transferring a block from one stack to another, and adds them to the BFS queue. It keeps track of the total cost of each state, and updates it whenever a cheaper path to a state is found. When all blocks are correctly sorted, it stops the BFS and traces back from the solution state to the initial state to get the list of block transfers.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm will return a list of edges that form the shortest path. Convert this list of edges into a list of transfer pairs.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs):
    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])
    visited = set([initial_state])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal_state:
            return path
        for next_state, cost in get_neighbors(state, costs):
            if next_state not in visited:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [cost]))
                visited.add(next_state)
    return []

def get_neighbors(state, costs):
    neighbors = []
    for i, stack in enumerate(state):
        if stack:
            for j, next_stack in enumerate(state):
                if i != j and (not next_stack or next_stack[-1] == stack[-1]) and len(next_stack) < 4:
                    next_state = state[:]
                    next_state[i] = stack[:-1]
                    next_state[j] = next_stack + [stack[-1]]
                    neighbors.append((next_state, (i, j, costs[j])))
    return neighbors

def solve(stacks):
    initial_state = [list(reversed(stack)) for stack in stacks]
    goal_state = [['Green', 'Green', 'Green'], [], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], [], ['Red', 'Red', 'Red'], []]
    costs = {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 5, 3: 5, 4: 3, 5: 1}
    path = bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs)
    return [(i, j) for i, j, cost in path]

stacks = [['Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow'], [], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Red'], [], ['Green', 'Green', 'Red', 'Yellow'], []]
print(solve(stacks))
```

This script first reverses each stack in the initial state because Python lists are more efficient when popping from the end. It then calls the bfs function to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The bfs function uses a queue to keep track of the states to visit and a set to keep track of the visited states. It pops a state from the queue, checks if it is the goal state, and if not, it adds its neighbors to the queue. The get_neighbors function returns all possible states that can be reached from the current state by moving a block from one stack to another. The solve function then converts the path returned by the bfs function into a list of transfer pairs.

This script first defines a BFS function that takes the initial state of the stacks as input and returns the list of transfer pairs. It uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been visited. It then defines a helper function `is_goal` that checks if a state is a goal state, i.e., all the stacks are sorted. It also defines a helper function `get_next_states` that generates all possible next states from a given state by moving a block from one stack to another. Finally, it calls the BFS function with the initial state of the stacks and prints the result.

LLM  program was killed because it exceeded the time limit.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

The steps taken are as follows:

1. Create a function to check if a move is valid. A move is valid if the destination stack is empty or if the top block of the destination stack is the same color as the block being moved, and the destination stack has less than 4 blocks.

2. Create a function to calculate the cost of a move. The cost is determined by the destination stack index.

3. Create a function to generate all possible moves from a given state.

4. Create a function to check if a state is a goal state. A state is a goal state if all stacks are either empty or contain 3 blocks of the same color.

5. Implement the BFS algorithm. Start with the initial state and explore all possible moves, keeping track of the total cost. When a goal state is reached, return the moves that led to that state.

6. Run the BFS algorithm with the given initial state.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

# Define the cost of moving a block to each stack
costs = {0: 6, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 6}

# Define the initial state of the stacks
initial_state = [['Green', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Green'], [], ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Red', 'Blue'], [], [], ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red']]

def is_valid_move(state, src, dest):
    if not state[src]:
        return False
    if not state[dest] or state[dest][-1] == state[src][-1] and len(state[dest]) < 4:
        return True
    return False

def calculate_cost(src, dest):
    return costs[dest]

def generate_moves(state):
    moves = []
    for src in range(6):
        for dest in range(6):
            if src != dest and is_valid_move(state, src, dest):
                new_state = deepcopy(state)
                new_state[dest].append(new_state[src].pop())
                moves.append((new_state, (src, dest), calculate_cost(src, dest)))
    return moves

def is_goal_state(state):
    for stack in state:
        if stack and (len(stack) != 3 or len(set(stack)) != 1):
            return False
    return True

def bfs():
    queue = deque([(initial_state, [], 0)])
    while queue:
        state, path, cost = queue.popleft()
        if is_goal_state(state):
            return path
        for new_state, move, move_cost in generate_moves(state):
            queue.append((new_state, path + [move], cost + move_cost))

print(bfs())
```

This script will output the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

In this problem, we will use BFS to explore all possible moves from the current state of the stacks, and keep track of the minimum cost to reach each state. The states are represented as a tuple of stacks, and the moves are represented as a tuple of two indices (from_stack, to_stack).

This script starts by initializing the visited dictionary with the start state and its cost and moves (0 and an empty list, respectively). Then it enters a loop where it pops a state from the queue, and for each stack in the state, if it's not empty, it tries to move the top block to each other stack. If the move is valid (the destination stack is not full and the top block is the same color or the stack is empty), it creates a new state, calculates its cost and moves, and if the new state has not been visited or its cost is less than the previously visited cost, it updates the visited dictionary and appends the new state to the queue. Finally, it returns the moves of the end state, which is the state where all blocks are sorted.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

The algorithm starts by initializing a queue with the initial state of the stacks. It then enters a loop where it dequeues a state, generates all possible next states by moving a block from one stack to another, and enqueues these states. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of each state and the moves that led to it. When a state where all stacks are sorted is dequeued, the algorithm returns the moves that led to this state.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_sorted(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

def get_moves(stacks):
    moves = []
    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
        if stack:
            for j, target in enumerate(stacks):
                if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == stack[-1]):
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

def solve(stacks):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        stacks, path, cost = queue.popleft()
        if str(stacks) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(str(stacks))
        if is_sorted(stacks):
            return path
        for move in get_moves(stacks):
            new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
            block = new_stacks[move[0]].pop()
            new_stacks[move[1]].append(block)
            new_cost = cost + {0: 2, 1: 4, 2: 6, 3: 6, 4: 6, 5: 7}[move[1]]
            queue.append((new_stacks, path + [move], new_cost))
    return []

stacks = [[], [], ['Green', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Yellow'], [], ['Red', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow']]
print(solve(stacks))
```

This script will print the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. Note that the script does not guarantee to find the solution with the least cost, as it does not take into account the cost of moving a block when generating the next states. To find the solution with the least cost, a different algorithm such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm should be used.

This problem is a variant of the Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible move.
2. Use a BFS algorithm to explore the graph. Start from the initial state and explore all possible moves. Keep track of the cost of each move and the total cost to reach each state.
3. When a state where all stacks are sorted is found, backtrack to find the sequence of moves that led to this state. This sequence of moves is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the sequence of moves with the least cost that sorts the blocks. The `bfs` function takes the initial state of the stacks and the costs of moving a block to each stack as input and returns the sequence of moves as a list of tuples. The `is_sorted` function checks if all stacks are sorted.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the corresponding block transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to visit. Initially, the queue contains only the initial state. Then, for each node in the queue, the algorithm generates all possible states that can be reached by transferring a single block and adds them to the queue. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of reaching each state and the block transfer that led to that state.

4. When the BFS algorithm finds the goal state, it backtracks from the goal state to the initial state to find the sequence of block transfers that led to the goal state. This sequence is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

    goal = [sorted(stack) for stack in stacks]

stacks = [[], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], [], [], ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green'], ['Green', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red']]
print(bfs(stacks))
```

This script starts by defining a helper function `get_moves` that generates all possible moves from a given state. It then defines a `bfs` function that uses a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The `bfs` function keeps track of the path taken to reach the goal state and returns this path when the goal state is reached. The script then calls the `bfs` function with the initial state of the stacks and prints the resulting path.

Note: This script assumes that the cost of moving a block is the same for all stacks. If the cost varies depending on the stack, you would need to modify the `bfs` function to take into account the cost when choosing the next move.

This problem is a variation of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an added cost factor. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    moves = []
    visited = set()
    heap = [(0, stacks, [])]
    while heap:
        cost, stacks, path = heapq.heappop(heap)
        state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)
        if state in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(state)
        if is_sorted(stacks):
            moves = path
            break
        for i in range(6):
            if not stacks[i]:
                continue
            for j in range(6):
                if i != j and (not stacks[j] or stacks[j][-1] == stacks[i][-1]) and len(stacks[j]) < 4:
                    new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
                    block = new_stacks[i].pop()
                    new_stacks[j].append(block)
                    new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                    new_path = path + [(i, j)]
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_cost, new_stacks, new_path))
    return moves

def is_sorted(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

stacks = [['Green', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Red'], ['Blue', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], [], ['Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow'], [], []]
costs = {0: 2, 1: 7, 2: 4, 3: 7, 4: 6, 5: 3}
print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it continues to the next iteration. If the state is sorted, it breaks the loop and returns the path. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and pushes them to the queue. The cost of a move is added to the total cost, and the move is appended to the path. The is_sorted function checks if all stacks are sorted by checking if each stack contains at most one color.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to visit. It starts with the initial state and visits all its neighbors before moving to the next level. It keeps track of the visited nodes to avoid visiting the same node twice.

4. For each node, it calculates the total cost of reaching that node from the initial state. If it finds a cheaper path to a node, it updates the total cost and the path.

5. Once it reaches the goal state, it returns the path with the least cost.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def restricted_sorting(stacks):
    costs = {0: 5, 1: 1, 2: 6, 3: 7, 4: 7, 5: 7}
    initial_state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)
    goal_state = ((), (), ('Green', 'Green', 'Green'), ('Red', 'Red', 'Red'), ('Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'), ('Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'))
    queue = deque([(initial_state, [], 0)])
    visited = {initial_state: 0}

    while queue:
        state, path, cost = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal_state:

This script uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible moves from the current state of the stacks. It keeps track of the visited states to avoid cycles. The search stops when it finds a state where all stacks are sorted by shade. The script returns the list of moves that leads to this state.

Please note that this script does not take into account the cost of moving blocks. If you want to find the solution with the least cost, you would need to use a different algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The edges between the nodes represent the possible moves from one state to another. The weight of each edge is the cost of moving a block from one stack to another.

2. Start from the initial state and perform a BFS traversal of the graph. Keep track of the cost of reaching each node from the initial state.

3. When a node representing a sorted state is reached, stop the traversal. The path from the initial state to this node represents the sequence of moves with the least cost.

4. Convert this path into a list of transfer pairs and return it.

Here is a Python script that implements this algorithm:

This script starts by initializing a queue with the initial state of the stacks, an empty list of moves, and a cost of 0. It then enters a loop where it pops a state from the queue, checks if it's sorted, and if not, generates all possible next states by moving a block from one stack to another. It adds these new states to the queue along with the updated list of moves and cost. The loop continues until a sorted state is found, at which point it returns the list of moves that led to this state.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the corresponding block transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the final state. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all possible block transfers. It keeps track of the total cost of the block transfers and the sequence of block transfers.

3. The BFS algorithm stops when it finds the final state. The sequence of block transfers along the shortest path is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def bfs(stacks, costs):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        stacks, moves, cost = queue.popleft()

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the sequence of block transfers with the least possible cost. The `bfs` function takes as input the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack. It returns the sequence of block transfers as a list of tuples. The `is_sorted` function checks if all the blocks are correctly sorted.

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

This problem is a variation of the Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def get_cost(from_stack, to_stack):
    cost = {0: 1, 1: 5, 2: 6, 3: 7, 4: 7, 5: 5}
    return cost[from_stack] + cost[to_stack]

def get_moves(stacks):

            for j, to_stack in enumerate(stacks):
                if i != j and (not to_stack or to_stack[-1] == stack[-1]):
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

def dfs(stacks, moves, cost):
    if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks if stack):
        return moves
    next_moves = get_moves(stacks)
    heapq.heapify(next_moves)
    while next_moves:
        from_stack, to_stack = heapq.heappop(next_moves)
        next_stacks = stacks[:]
        next_stacks[to_stack].append(next_stacks[from_stack].pop())
        next_cost = cost + get_cost(from_stack, to_stack)
        result = dfs(next_stacks, moves + [(from_stack, to_stack)], next_cost)
        if result is not None:
            return result

stacks = [['Yellow', 'Green', 'Green', 'Blue'], [], [], ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], [], ['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Red']]
print(dfs(stacks, [], 0))
```

This script first defines a function `get_cost` to calculate the cost of moving a block from one stack to another. Then it defines a function `get_moves` to get all possible moves. The `dfs` function is the main function that uses a depth-first search to find the solution. It first checks if all stacks are sorted. If they are, it returns the moves. Otherwise, it gets all possible next moves, sorts them by cost using a priority queue, and then recursively calls the `dfs` function for each next move. The initial stacks are passed to the `dfs` function to start the search. The result is the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible move. The weight of each edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node. This can be done by storing the previous node and the move that led to the current node.

4. Once the goal state is reached, backtrack from the goal state to the initial state to find the sequence of moves.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the colors of the blocks in the stack.

2. Create a queue and add the initial state to the queue.

3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first state from the queue. For each possible move from this state, calculate the cost of the move and the resulting state. If the resulting state has not been visited before or if the cost of reaching this state is less than the previously calculated cost, add the resulting state to the queue and update the cost and the move that led to this state.

4. Continue this process until all states have been visited. The state where all stacks are sorted will have the minimum cost and the moves that led to this state will be the solution to the problem.

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack. The first element of each tuple is the color of the blocks in the stack, and the second element is the cost of moving a block to that stack.

2. Initialize the graph with the initial state of the stacks.

3. Perform a BFS on the graph. For each node, generate all possible next states by moving a block from one stack to another. Add these states to the graph and the queue of the BFS.

4. Keep track of the cost of each state by adding the cost of the move that led to that state to the cost of the previous state.

5. When a state where all stacks are sorted is found, return the sequence of moves that led to that state.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def solve(stacks):
    costs = {0: 5, 1: 8, 2: 1, 3: 6, 4: 8, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 8}
    initial_state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)
    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])
    visited = set([initial_state])

    while queue:
        state, moves = queue.popleft()
        if is_sorted(state):
            return moves
        for i in range(8):
            if not state[i]:
                continue
            for j in range(8):
                if i == j or (state[j] and state[j][0] != state[i][0]):
                    continue
                new_state = deepcopy(state)
                new_state[j] = (new_state[i][0],) + new_state[j]
                new_state[i] = new_state[i][1:]
                new_state = tuple(new_state)
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    queue.append((new_state, moves + [(i, j)]))

def is_sorted(state):
    for stack in state:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This script first converts the initial state of the stacks to a tuple of tuples, so it can be used as a key in a set. It then performs a BFS on the graph of states, generating all possible next states and adding them to the queue. When a sorted state is found, it returns the sequence of moves that led to that state. The `is_sorted` function checks if a state is sorted by checking if each stack contains blocks of only one color.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible move. The weight of each edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all the blocks are correctly sorted.

3. The BFS algorithm will return a list of moves that leads to the goal state with the least possible cost. Each move is represented by a tuple where the first element is the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the second element is the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

Here is a python script that implements the above steps:

```python

                    next_state[i] = stack[:-1]
                    next_state[j] = next_stack + [stack[-1]]
                    moves.append((next_state, (i, j, costs[j])))
    return moves

costs = {0: 1, 1: 6, 2: 6, 3: 2, 4: 9, 5: 2, 6: 9, 7: 6}

print(bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs))
```

Please note that this script assumes that the goal state is known. If the goal state is not known, it can be computed from the initial state by sorting the blocks by shade.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

2. Use the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all the blocks are correctly sorted.

3. The BFS algorithm starts from the initial state and explores all the neighboring states. It then explores the neighbors of the neighbors and so on, until it reaches the goal state.

4. To keep track of the path, each node stores the state of the stacks, the cost to reach this state, and the block transfer that leads to this state.

5. The BFS algorithm uses a priority queue to decide which node to explore next. The node with the lowest cost is always chosen first.

6. When the BFS algorithm reaches the goal state, it backtracks from the goal state to the initial state to find the path with the least cost.

7. The solution is the list of block transfers along this path.

This script uses a priority queue to implement the BFS algorithm. The priority queue ensures that the node with the lowest cost is always chosen first. The script also uses a set to keep track of the visited states to avoid visiting the same state twice.

This script defines a BFS function that takes the initial state of the stacks as input and returns the list of transfer pairs that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The BFS function uses a queue to keep track of the states to be explored and a set to keep track of the states that have already been visited. It also defines helper functions to check if a state is a goal state and to get the possible actions from a state. The script then calls the BFS function with the initial state of the stacks and prints the result.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a function to check if a move is valid. A move is valid if the block is moved to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

2. Create a function to generate all possible moves from a given state.

3. Create a function to check if a state is the goal state. A state is the goal state if all the blocks are correctly sorted.

4. Implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. It starts by visiting the initial state and then visits all the neighbors of the initial state before moving on to their neighbors. The algorithm keeps track of the path from the initial state to the current state and the total cost of the path. When it finds the goal state, it returns the path with the least cost.

5. The solution is the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost.

Here is the python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def is_valid_move(state, from_stack, to_stack):
    if not state[from_stack] or (state[to_stack] and state[from_stack][-1] != state[to_stack][-1]):

                moves.append((new_state, (from_stack, to_stack)))
    return moves

    while queue:
        state, path, cost = queue.popleft()
        if str(state) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(str(state))
        if is_goal_state(state):
            return path
        for new_state, move in generate_moves(state):
            new_cost = cost + {0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 7, 3: 1, 4: 8, 5: 8, 6: 8, 7: 4}[move[1]]

print(bfs(initial_state))
```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue and checks if it has been visited before. If it has, it continues to the next iteration. If it hasn't, it checks if the state is sorted. If it is, it sets the moves to the current path and breaks the loop. If it isn't, it generates all possible moves from the current state and pushes them to the queue. The moves are generated by iterating over all pairs of stacks and checking if a block can be moved from one stack to the other. The cost of a move is added to the current cost and the move is added to the current path. The new state, cost, and path are then pushed to the queue. The function finally returns the moves that lead to a sorted state with the least cost.

This script first defines a helper function `get_cost` to calculate the cost of moving a block from one stack to another. It then defines another helper function `get_moves` to generate all possible moves. The main function `restricted_sorting` uses a priority queue to always select the move with the least cost. It uses a set `visited` to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles. It then iterates until the queue is empty or all stacks are sorted. For each state, it generates all possible moves and pushes them into the queue. If a state is sorted, it returns the path to this state. If no sorted state is found, it returns an empty list.

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves. It keeps track of the current state of the stacks, the sequence of moves made to reach the current state, and the total cost of these moves. When it finds a solution, it checks if the cost is less than the current minimum cost. If it is, it updates the minimum cost and the corresponding solution. The script continues to explore all possible moves until it has explored all possible states. The final solution is the sequence of moves with the minimum cost.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an added cost factor. It can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The edges between nodes represent a valid move of a block from one stack to another. The weight of the edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. Keep track of the path taken to reach the goal state. This path represents the sequence of moves to sort the blocks with the least possible cost.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, [])])
    seen = set([start])
    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path
        for next_state, action in neighbors(state):
            if next_state not in seen:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [action]))
                seen.add(next_state)

def neighbors(state):
    result = []
    for i, stack in enumerate(state):
        if stack:
            block = stack[-1]
            for j, target in enumerate(state):
                if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == block) and len(target) < 5:
                    next_state = state[:]
                    next_state[i] = stack[:-1]
                    next_state[j] = target + [block]
                    action = (i, j)
                    result.append((next_state, action))
    return result

def solve(stacks):
    start = [list(reversed(stack)) for stack in stacks]
    goal = [sorted(stack) for stack in start]
    return bfs(start, goal)

stacks = [[], [], ['Green', 'Yellow', 'Black', 'Red', 'Black'], ['Black', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], ['Green', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Black'], [], [], ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Yellow']]
print(solve(stacks))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The `neighbors` function generates all possible next states from the current state by moving a block from one stack to another. The `solve` function starts the search from the initial state and continues until it finds the goal state.

Please note that this script does not take into account the cost of moving blocks to different stacks. To incorporate this, you would need to modify the `neighbors` function to calculate the cost of each move and use a priority queue in the `bfs` function to always select the move with the least cost. This would turn the algorithm into a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the colors of the blocks in the stack.

2. Create a queue and add the initial state to the queue.

3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first state from the queue. For each possible move from this state, calculate the cost of the move and the resulting state. If the resulting state has not been visited before or if the cost of reaching this state is less than the previously calculated cost, add the state to the queue and update the cost and the move that led to this state.

4. Continue this process until all states have been visited. The state where all stacks are sorted will have the minimum cost and the moves that led to this state will be the solution to the problem.

Here is the Python script that implements this algorithm:

```python
from collections import deque
from itertools import product

def restricted_sorting(stacks):
    costs = {tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks): 0}
    moves = {tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks): []}
    queue = deque([tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)])

    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()
        for i, j in product(range(8), repeat=2):
            if i != j and state[i] and (not state[j] or state[i][-1] == state[j][-1]) and len(state[j]) < 5:
                new_state = list(list(stack) for stack in state)
                new_state[j].append(new_state[i].pop())
                new_state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_state)
                cost = costs[state] + {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 8, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 6, 7: 3}[j]
                if new_state not in costs or cost < costs[new_state]:
                    costs[new_state] = cost
                    moves[new_state] = moves[state] + [(i, j)]
                    queue.append(new_state)

    sorted_state = tuple(tuple(sorted((color for color in stack if color), reverse=True)) for stack in stacks)
    return moves[sorted_state]

stacks = [['Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue'], ['Black', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red', 'Black'], [], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Black', 'Yellow'], [], [], ['Blue', 'Red', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'Green'], []]
print(restricted_sorting(stacks))
```

This script will print the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it continues to the next iteration. If the state is sorted, it breaks the loop and returns the path. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from the current state and pushes them to the queue. The cost of a move is calculated by adding the cost of the destination stack to the current cost. The is_sorted function checks if all stacks are sorted by checking if each stack contains blocks of only one color.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it continues to the next iteration. If the state is sorted, it breaks the loop and returns the path. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and pushes them to the queue. The cost of a move is calculated by adding the cost of the destination stack to the current cost. The is_sorted function checks if all stacks are sorted by ensuring that each stack contains at most one color.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an added cost function. It can be solved using a depth-first search algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The algorithm keeps track of the current state of the stacks and the total cost so far. It then generates all possible moves from the current state, calculates the cost for each move, and adds the moves to the priority queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def get_moves(state):
    moves = []
    for i, stack in enumerate(state):
        if stack:
            for j, target in enumerate(state):
                if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == stack[-1]):
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

def get_cost(move, costs):
    return costs[move[1]]

def is_sorted(state):
    for stack in state:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False

            continue
        visited.add(str(state))

            new_state = state[:]
            new_state[move[1]] = new_state[move[1]] + [new_state[move[0]].pop()]
            new_cost = cost + get_cost(move, costs)
            heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_state, path + [move]))

state = [[], [], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'Red'], [], ['Red', 'Green', 'Red', 'Black', 'Yellow'], [], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Black'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Black', 'Red', 'Blue']]
costs = {0: 6, 1: 2, 2: 7, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 5, 6: 3, 7: 2}

print(restricted_sorting(state, costs))
```

This script first defines helper functions to get all possible moves from a given state, calculate the cost of a move, check if a state is sorted, and solve the problem using a priority queue. It then defines the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack, and calls the main function to solve the problem. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the block transfer.

2. Use the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all the blocks are correctly sorted.

3. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It starts by exploring the initial state and then explores all its neighboring states. It continues this process until it finds the goal state or it has explored all the states.

4. To keep track of the shortest path, we maintain a parent dictionary where each key is a state and its value is the state from which it was reached. We also maintain a cost dictionary where each key is a state and its value is the total cost to reach that state from the initial state.

5. Once we find the goal state, we can use the parent dictionary to backtrack from the goal state to the initial state to find the shortest path.

6. The shortest path is the list of block transfers with the least possible cost.

Here is a python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(initial_state, goal_state, cost):
    queue = deque([initial_state])
    parent = {initial_state: None}
    cost_so_far = {initial_state: 0}

    while queue:
        current_state = queue.popleft()

        if current_state == goal_state:
            break

        for next_state in get_neighbors(current_state):
            new_cost = cost_so_far[current_state] + cost[next_state]

            if next_state not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[next_state]:
                cost_so_far[next_state] = new_cost
                parent[next_state] = current_state
                queue.append(next_state)

    return parent, cost_so_far

def get_neighbors(state):
    # This function returns all the neighboring states of the given state.
    # A neighboring state is a state that can be reached by transferring one block.

def get_path(parent, initial_state, goal_state):
    path = []
    current_state = goal_state

    while current_state != initial_state:
        previous_state = parent[current_state]
        path.append((previous_state, current_state))
        current_state = previous_state

    path.reverse()
    return path
```

Note: The `get_neighbors` function is not implemented in this script. This function depends on the specific rules of the game and needs to be implemented accordingly.

This script first defines a BFS function that finds the shortest path from the start state to the goal state. It then defines a neighbors function that generates all possible next states from a given state. Finally, it defines a solve function that uses these two functions to solve the problem. The solve function first reverses the order of the blocks in each stack, because the topmost block in each stack is represented as the last item in each list. It then calls the BFS function to find the shortest path from the start state to the goal state. The goal state is a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The BFS function returns a list of transfer pairs that form the shortest path.

This script first defines a helper function `get_cost` to calculate the cost of moving a block from one stack to another. It then defines the main function `restricted_sorting` which uses a priority queue to always select the move with the least cost. It uses a set `visited` to keep track of the states that have been visited to avoid cycles. It then iterates over all possible moves and pushes them into the queue with their associated costs. The function returns the moves when all stacks are either empty or contain 4 blocks of the same shade.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

            next_state[j] = state[j] + [state[i][-1]]

print(bfs(start))
```

This script defines a breadth-first search function that takes the initial state of the stacks as input and returns the list of transfer pairs that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted. The `is_goal` function checks if the current state is the goal state, i.e., all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade. The `get_actions` function generates all possible actions from the current state, i.e., all possible pairs of stacks where a block can be transferred from one stack to another. The script then calls the `bfs` function with the initial state of the stacks and prints the resulting list of transfer pairs.

Please note that this script does not take into account the cost of moving blocks to different stacks. To incorporate this into the solution, you would need to modify the `get_actions` function to generate actions based on the cost of moving blocks, and modify the `bfs` function to choose the action with the least cost at each step.

This script first defines the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving one block to the top of each stack. It then defines a function to check if a move is valid, a function to check if the stacks are sorted, a function to find the move with the least cost, a function to perform a move, and a function to solve the problem. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The script then prints the solution.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the colors of the blocks in the stack. The top block is at the end of the tuple.

2. Create a queue and a visited set. Add the initial state to the queue and the visited set.

3. While the queue is not empty, remove a state from the queue. For each possible move from this state, if the resulting state has not been visited, add it to the queue and the visited set, and record the move and the cost of the move.

4. When a sorted state is found, backtrack from this state to the initial state to find the sequence of moves.

5. Return the sequence of moves with the least cost.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The edges between nodes represent a valid move of a block from one stack to another. The weight of the edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. It starts with the initial state and explores all its neighbors before moving on to their neighbors. It keeps track of the shortest path to each node by storing the predecessor of each node.

4. Once the goal state is reached, backtrack from the goal state to the initial state using the stored predecessors to find the shortest path.

5. The shortest path is the sequence of moves with the least cost.

LLM  program was killed because it exceeded the time limit.
This problem can be solved using a priority queue and a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The priority queue is used to keep track of the states with the least cost. The BFS algorithm is used to explore all possible states from the current state. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a priority queue and add the initial state with cost 0.
2. While the priority queue is not empty, pop the state with the least cost.
3. If this state is the goal state (all stacks are sorted), return the actions that lead to this state.
4. Otherwise, generate all possible states from the current state by moving a block from one stack to another. Add these states to the priority queue with their corresponding costs.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the goal state is found or all states have been explored.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import heapq

def restricted_sorting(stacks):
    costs = {0: 6, 1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 8, 4: 7, 5: 5, 6: 9, 7: 9}
    goal = [['Blue']*4, ['Red']*4, ['Yellow']*4, ['Green']*4, ['Black']*4, [], [], []]
    queue = [(0, stacks, [])]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        cost, state, actions = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if state == goal:
            return actions
        if str(state) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(str(state))
        for i in range(8):
            if state[i]:
                for j in range(8):
                    if i != j and (not state[j] or state[j][-1] == state[i][-1]) and len(state[j]) < 5:
                        new_state = [list(s) for s in state]
                        new_state[j].append(new_state[i].pop())
                        new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                        new_actions = actions + [(i, j)]
                        heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_state, new_actions))

stacks = [[], [], [], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Black'], ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Black', 'Red', 'Yellow'], [], ['Green', 'Green', 'Black', 'Green', 'Black']]
print(restricted_sorting(stacks))

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. It then enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost. If the state has been visited before, it is skipped. If all stacks in the state are sorted, the moves that led to this state are returned. Otherwise, all possible moves are tried and the new states are added to the queue with their corresponding costs. The process continues until a solution is found.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it continues to the next iteration. If the state is sorted, it returns the path. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and pushes them to the queue. The cost of a move is added to the total cost, and the move is appended to the path. The script continues this process until it finds a solution or the queue is empty.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the colors of the blocks in the stack.

2. Create a queue and add the initial state to the queue.

3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first state from the queue. For each possible move from this state, calculate the cost of the move and the resulting state. If the resulting state has not been visited before or if the cost of reaching this state is less than the previously calculated cost, add the state to the queue and update the cost and the move that led to this state.

4. Continue this process until all states have been visited. The state where all stacks are sorted will have the minimum cost and the moves that led to this state will be the solution to the problem.

Here is the Python script that implements this algorithm:

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

# Define the cost of moving a block to each stack
costs = {0: 5, 1: 5, 2: 5, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 5, 6: 9, 7: 6}

# Define the initial state of the stacks
stacks = [[], ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'Green'], [], [], ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Black'], ['Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow'], [], ['Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'Red', 'Black']]

# Define the queue for the BFS algorithm
queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])

# Define the set of visited states
visited = set()

while queue:
    # Pop the next state from the queue
    stacks, moves, cost = queue.popleft()

    # Convert the state to a tuple for hashing
    state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)

    # If we have visited this state before, skip it
    if state in visited:
        continue

    # Add the state to the set of visited states
    visited.add(state)

    # If all stacks are sorted, return the moves
    if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks if stack):
        print(moves)
        break

    # Try moving a block from each stack to each other stack
    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
        if stack:
            for j, target in enumerate(stacks):
                if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == stack[-1]) and len(target) < 5:
                    # Create a copy of the stacks and moves
                    new_stacks = deepcopy(stacks)
                    new_moves = moves[:]

                    # Move the block
                    new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())

                    # Add the move to the list of moves
                    new_moves.append((i, j))

                    # Add the new state to the queue
                    queue.append((new_stacks, new_moves, cost + costs[j]))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible states of the stacks. It keeps track of the moves that led to each state and the total cost of those moves. When it finds a state where all stacks are sorted, it prints the moves that led to that state and breaks the loop. The moves are reported in Python syntax as a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks and each edge represents a possible block transfer. The weight of each edge is the cost of the transfer.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. Keep track of the path taken to reach the goal state. This path will be the list of transfer pairs.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(stacks, costs):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

                        next_path = path + [(i, j)]
                        queue.append((next_state, next_path))

costs = {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 9, 3: 8, 4: 3, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: 5}
print(bfs(stacks, costs))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The path is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred. The script returns this list of tuples.

Please note that this script does not take into account the cost of moving blocks to different stacks. To incorporate this, you would need to use a priority queue instead of a regular queue and prioritize states with lower total cost. This would turn the algorithm into a version of Dijkstra's algorithm.

costs = {0: 4, 1: 8, 2: 9, 3: 9, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: 6}

print(solve(stacks, costs))
```

This script works by maintaining a priority queue of states to explore, sorted by their cost. It starts with the initial state and explores all possible moves from that state, adding the resulting states to the queue. It keeps track of states it has already seen to avoid exploring the same state multiple times. When it finds a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, it returns the moves that led to that state. The use of a priority queue ensures that it explores lower-cost states first, so the first solution it finds will be the one with the lowest cost.

This script first defines a helper function `get_cost` to calculate the cost of moving a block from one stack to another. It then defines the main function `restricted_sorting` which uses a priority queue to always select the move with the least cost. It uses a set `visited` to keep track of the states that have already been visited. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue, checks if it has been visited before, and if not, checks if it is a goal state (all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade). If it is a goal state, it returns the moves that led to this state. If it is not a goal state, it generates all possible moves from this state and pushes them into the queue. The function returns an empty list if no solution is found. The script then calls this function with the given initial state and costs and prints the result.

{'difficulty': 5, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 8 stacks each with a capacity of 5 blocks, with 4 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 4 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 6, 1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 8, 4: 1, 5: 6, 6: 4, 7: 1}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The edges between the nodes represent the possible moves from one state to another. The weight of the edges is the cost of moving a block from one stack to another.

2. Initialize the BFS queue with the initial state of the stacks and set the cost of the initial state to 0.

3. While the BFS queue is not empty, remove a node from the queue. For each possible move from the current state, calculate the cost of the move and update the cost of the new state. If the new state has not been visited before or if the new cost is less than the previous cost, add the new state to the BFS queue.

4. Continue this process until all the states have been visited. The minimum cost path from the initial state to the final state is the solution to the problem.

Here is a Python script that implements the above steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(initial_state, cost):
    queue = deque([(initial_state, [], 0)])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        state, path, total_cost = queue.popleft()
        if state in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(state)
        if is_goal(state):
            return path
        for next_state, move, move_cost in get_moves(state, cost):
            if next_state not in visited:
                queue.append((next_state, path + [move], total_cost + move_cost))

def is_goal(state):
    for stack in state:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

def get_moves(state, cost):
    moves = []
    for i, stack in enumerate(state):
        if stack:
            block = stack[-1]
            for j, next_stack in enumerate(state):
                if i != j and (not next_stack or next_stack[-1] == block):
                    next_state = state[:]
                    next_state[i] = stack[:-1]
                    next_state[j] = next_stack + [block]
                    moves.append((next_state, (i, j), cost[j]))
    return moves

initial_state = [['Yellow', 'Green', 'Green', 'Black', 'Black'], [], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Black', 'Green', 'Red'], ['Red', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], [], [], ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red'], []]
cost = {0: 6, 1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 8, 4: 1, 5: 6, 6: 4, 7: 1}
print(bfs(initial_state, cost))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum cost path from the initial state to the final state. The `bfs` function is the main function that implements the BFS algorithm. The `is_goal` function checks if a state is the final state. The `get_moves` function generates all possible moves from a state.

This problem can be solved using a priority queue and a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The BFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves from the current state.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

    queue = [(0, stacks, [])]

```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0, and a set of visited states. It then enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it is skipped. Otherwise, it is marked as visited. If this state is a goal state (all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade), the moves that lead to this state are returned. Otherwise, all possible moves from this state are explored. If a move is valid (a block can be moved from one stack to another without violating the rules), the new state and its cost are added to the queue.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty list of moves. It then enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it is skipped. If it is a goal state (all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade), the list of moves that lead to this state is returned. Otherwise, all possible moves from this state are tried and the resulting states are added to the queue with their costs. The cost of a state is the sum of the costs of the moves that lead to it. The cost of a move is given by the cost of moving a block to the target stack. If the queue becomes empty, there is no solution and the function returns None.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    # Initialize the priority queue with the initial state and cost 0
    queue = [(0, stacks, [])]
    # Set of visited states
    visited = set()
    # While there are states to process
    while queue:
        # Pop the state with the least cost
        cost, stacks, moves = heapq.heappop(queue)
        # Convert the current state to a tuple to be able to store it in a set
        state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)
        # If this state has been visited before, skip it
        if state in visited:
            continue
        # Mark this state as visited
        visited.add(state)
        # If this state is a goal state, return the moves that lead to it
        if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks if stack):
            return moves
        # For each pair of stacks
        for i in range(len(stacks)):
            for j in range(len(stacks)):
                # If the stack is not empty and the block can be moved
                if stacks[i] and (not stacks[j] or stacks[i][-1] == stacks[j][-1]) and i != j:
                    # Create a new state by moving the block
                    new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
                    new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())
                    # Calculate the cost of the move
                    new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                    # Add the new state to the queue
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_stacks, moves + [(i, j)]))

# Test the function
stacks = [[], [], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Black'], ['Red', 'Red', 'Blue', 'White', 'Blue', 'Black'], ['White', 'Green', 'Red', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Yellow'], [], ['White', 'Green', 'Green', 'White', 'Green', 'Green'], ['Black', 'Red', 'Red', 'Blue', 'White', 'Black'], [], []]
costs = {0: 7, 1: 7, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 10, 6: 5, 7: 5, 8: 4, 9: 8}
print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue and checks if it has been visited before. If it has, it skips it. If it hasn't, it marks it as visited and checks if it is a goal state. If it is, it returns the moves that lead to it. If it isn't, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the queue with their corresponding costs. The process continues until a goal state is found or all states have been visited.

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with backtracking. The algorithm will explore all possible moves and keep track of the minimum cost to reach the goal state. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack.
2. Define a function to check if a move is valid. A move is valid if the destination stack is empty or the top block of the destination stack is the same shade as the block being moved, and the destination stack has not reached its capacity.
3. Define a function to perform a move. This function will remove the top block from the source stack and add it to the destination stack, and update the total cost.
4. Define a function to check if the goal state has been reached. The goal state is reached when all non-empty stacks contain blocks of a single shade.
5. Implement the DFS algorithm with backtracking. The algorithm will explore all possible moves from the current state, and backtrack when it reaches a state where no further valid moves are possible. It will keep track of the minimum cost to reach the goal state.
6. Run the DFS algorithm from the initial state and return the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import copy

# Define the initial state of the stacks and the cost of moving a block to each stack
stacks = [['White', 'White', 'Yellow', 'White', 'White', 'Black'], [], ['Red', 'Red', 'Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red'], ['Black', 'Yellow', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Green'], ['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Black', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Red'], [], ['Red', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'White'], [], [], []]
costs = {0: 6, 1: 7, 2: 11, 3: 10, 4: 7, 5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 3, 8: 11, 9: 8}

# Define a function to check if a move is valid
def is_valid_move(stacks, src, dest):
    return stacks[src] and (not stacks[dest] or stacks[dest][-1] == stacks[src][-1]) and len(stacks[dest]) < 6

# Define a function to perform a move
def make_move(stacks, src, dest):
    stacks = copy.deepcopy(stacks)
    stacks[dest].append(stacks[src].pop())
    return stacks

# Define a function to check if the goal state has been reached
def is_goal_state(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if stack and len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

# Implement the DFS algorithm with backtracking
def dfs(stacks, cost, moves):
    if is_goal_state(stacks):
        return cost, moves
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_moves = None
    for src in range(10):
        for dest in range(10):
            if src != dest and is_valid_move(stacks, src, dest):
                new_stacks = make_move(stacks, src, dest)
                new_cost = cost + costs[dest]
                new_moves = moves + [(src, dest)]
                temp_cost, temp_moves = dfs(new_stacks, new_cost, new_moves)
                if temp_cost < min_cost:
                    min_cost = temp_cost
                    min_moves = temp_moves
    return min_cost, min_moves

# Run the DFS algorithm from the initial state
min_cost, min_moves = dfs(stacks, 0, [])
print(min_moves)
```

Please note that this script may take a long time to run due to the large number of possible moves. To speed up the script, you can add a memoization technique to avoid exploring the same state multiple times.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a dictionary to store the cost of moving a block to each stack.
2. Create a list to store the initial state of the stacks.
3. Create a function to check if the blocks are sorted correctly.
4. Create a function to generate all possible moves from the current state.
5. Use a BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves with the least cost.

Here is the Python script:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

# Cost of moving a block to each stack
cost = {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 3, 3: 6, 4: 9, 5: 6, 6: 6, 7: 10, 8: 2, 9: 5}

# Initial state of the stacks

# Function to check if the blocks are sorted correctly
def is_sorted(stacks):
    for stack in stacks:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

# Function to generate all possible moves from the current state
def generate_moves(stacks):
    moves = []
    for i in range(len(stacks)):
        if stacks[i]:
            for j in range(len(stacks)):
                if i != j and (not stacks[j] or stacks[j][-1] == stacks[i][-1]) and len(stacks[j]) < 6:
                    moves.append((i, j))
    return moves

# BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves with the least cost
def bfs(stacks):
    queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
    while queue:
        stacks, path, total_cost = queue.popleft()
        if is_sorted(stacks):
            return path
        for move in generate_moves(stacks):
            new_stacks = deepcopy(stacks)
            block = new_stacks[move[0]].pop()
            new_stacks[move[1]].append(block)
            new_path = path + [move]
            new_cost = total_cost + cost[move[1]]
            queue.append((new_stacks, new_path, new_cost))
    return []

print(bfs(stacks))
```

This script will output the sequence of moves with the least cost to sort the blocks correctly. The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the blocks in the stack. The first block in the tuple is the top block in the stack.

2. Create a queue and a visited set. Add the initial state to the queue and the visited set.

3. While the queue is not empty, remove a state from the queue. For each possible move from this state, if the resulting state is not in the visited set, add it to the queue and the visited set. Also, store the move and the previous state.

4. When a sorted state is found, backtrack from this state to the initial state using the stored moves and previous states. This gives the list of moves to sort the blocks.

5. The cost of a move is given by the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. To find the moves with the least cost, use a priority queue instead of a regular queue. The priority of a state is the negative of the cost of the moves to reach this state. This ensures that states with lower cost are explored first.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def restricted_sorting(stacks):
    costs = {0: 4, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 10, 4: 6, 5: 8, 6: 2, 7: 11, 8: 2, 9: 8}
    moves = defaultdict(list)
    prev = {}
    queue = [(0, tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks))]
    visited = set(queue)

    while queue:
        cost, state = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if all(len(stack) <= 1 or all(block == stack[1] for block in stack) for stack in state):
            path = []
            while state in prev:
                path.append(moves[state])
                state = prev[state]
            return path[::-1]
        for i, stack in enumerate(state):
            if stack:
                for j, dest in enumerate(state):
                    if i != j and (not dest or dest[0] == stack[0]) and len(dest) < 6:
                        new_state = list(list(s) for s in state)
                        new_state[i] = new_state[i][1:]
                        new_state[j] = [stack[0]] + new_state[j]
                        new_state = tuple(tuple(s) for s in new_state)
                        if new_state not in visited:
                            heapq.heappush(queue, (cost - costs[j], new_state))
                            visited.add(new_state)
                            prev[new_state] = state
                            moves[new_state] = (i, j)
    return []

stacks = [[], [], ['White', 'Black', 'Green', 'White', 'Green', 'Blue'], ['Red', 'Green', 'Black', 'Red', 'White', 'Yellow'], [], ['Yellow', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Green', 'White'], [], ['White', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Black'], [], ['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black']]
print(restricted_sorting(stacks))
```

This script returns the list of moves to sort the blocks with the least cost. The moves are represented as tuples of stack indices. The first index in a tuple is the index of the stack from which a block is picked up, and the second index is the index of the stack to which the block is transferred.

Incomplete generation by the LLM. Failed to extract the complete code
This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with backtracking. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is not feasible to solve it using a simple Python script. 

The problem involves multiple stacks and blocks of different shades. The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that each stack contains blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving blocks varies depending on the stack to which the block is moved. 

The problem can be solved in the following steps:

1. Represent the initial state of the stacks as a list of lists in Python. Each list represents a stack and the elements in the list represent the blocks in the stack. The leftmost item in each list represents the topmost block in the stack.

2. Define a function to calculate the cost of moving a block from one stack to another. The cost is determined by the index of the stack to which the block is moved.

3. Define a function to check if a move is valid. A move is valid if the stack from which the block is moved is not empty, the stack to which the block is moved is either empty or contains blocks of the same shade, and the move does not exceed the stack's capacity.

4. Define a function to perform a move. The function should update the state of the stacks and the total cost of the moves.

5. Use a DFS algorithm to explore all possible sequences of moves. The algorithm should start from the initial state and explore all possible moves from each state. The algorithm should backtrack when it reaches a state where no further moves are possible.

6. Keep track of the sequence of moves with the least cost. The sequence of moves is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of the stack from which a block is moved and the index of the stack to which it is moved.

7. Return the sequence of moves with the least cost.

This problem is complex and requires a good understanding of algorithms and data structures to solve. It is not feasible to provide a Python script that solves the problem in this response.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an added cost function. It can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, where we explore all possible moves from the current state and choose the one with the least cost. 

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the initial state of the stacks
stacks = [['Black', 'Black', 'White', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'White'], ['Black', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Green'], [], ['Black', 'White', 'Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Blue'], ['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Green', 'Green', 'Yellow'], [], ['Green', 'Black', 'Red', 'White', 'Yellow', 'Yellow'], [], [], []]

# Define the cost of moving one block to the top of each stack
costs = {0: 9, 1: 11, 2: 2, 3: 10, 4: 8, 5: 6, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 7, 9: 3}

# Define a queue for the BFS algorithm
queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])

# Define a set to store visited states
visited = set()

while queue:
    # Pop the current state, the moves to reach it, and its cost from the queue
    current_stacks, current_moves, current_cost = queue.popleft()

    # If this state has been visited before, skip it
    if str(current_stacks) in visited:
        continue

    # Mark this state as visited
    visited.add(str(current_stacks))

    # Check if the current state is a goal state
    if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in current_stacks if stack):
        # If it is, print the moves to reach it and its cost, and stop the algorithm
        print(current_moves, current_cost)
        break

    # For each pair of stacks
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            # If the first stack is not empty and the second stack is either empty or its top block is the same color as the top block of the first stack
            if current_stacks[i] and (not current_stacks[j] or current_stacks[i][-1] == current_stacks[j][-1]):
                # Copy the current state and the moves to reach it
                new_stacks = deepcopy(current_stacks)
                new_moves = deepcopy(current_moves)

                # Move the top block from the first stack to the second stack
                new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())

                # Add the move to the list of moves
                new_moves.append((i, j))

                # Add the new state, the moves to reach it, and its cost to the queue
                queue.append((new_stacks, new_moves, current_cost + costs[j]))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible states of the stacks. It keeps track of the moves to reach each state and its cost. When it finds a goal state (a state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single color), it prints the moves to reach it and its cost, and stops the algorithm.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the shades of the blocks in the stack.

2. Create a queue and enqueue the initial state of the stacks.

3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a state.

4. If this state is a goal state (i.e., all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade), return the path to this state.

5. Otherwise, for each possible move (i.e., transferring a block from one stack to another), enqueue the resulting state and the path to this state.

6. To minimize the cost, always choose the move with the least cost. The cost of a move is the cost of moving a block to the top of the destination stack.

7. To avoid visiting the same state multiple times, keep track of the visited states.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_goal_state(state):
    for stack in state:
        if len(set(stack)) > 1:
            return False

                    new_state[j].append(new_state[i].pop())
                    moves.append((new_state, cost, (i, j)))
    return moves

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    initial_state = [deque(stack) for stack in stacks]
    queue = deque([(initial_state, 0, [])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        state, cost, path = queue.popleft()
        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in state)

        if state_tuple in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(state_tuple)

        if is_goal_state(state):
            return path

        for new_state, new_cost, move in get_moves(state, costs):
            queue.append((new_state, cost + new_cost, path + [move]))

    return None

stacks = [[], ['Blue', 'Black', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'White', 'Green'], ['Green', 'Black', 'Red', 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], [], ['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue'], ['Black', 'White', 'White', 'Red', 'White', 'Black'], [], ['White', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Red'], [], []]
costs = [5, 4, 7, 7, 11, 11, 8, 3, 7, 9]

LLM  program executed successfully but no output produced by the LLM code.
This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack and contains the colors of the blocks in the stack.

2. The root of the graph is the initial state of the stacks.

3. For each node, generate all possible moves. A move is represented as a tuple (i, j), where i is the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and j is the index of the stack to which it is transferred. A move is valid if it does not violate the rules of the game.

4. For each move, calculate the cost of the move and update the total cost of the state.

5. Use a priority queue to store the nodes to be explored. The priority of a node is the total cost of the state. The node with the lowest cost is explored first.

6. If a state is reached that is already in the queue but with a higher cost, update the cost of the state in the queue.

7. If a state is reached that is already in the queue but with a lower or equal cost, ignore the state.

8. If a state is reached that is not in the queue, add it to the queue.

9. If a state is reached where all stacks are sorted, return the moves that led to this state.

10. If all nodes have been explored and no solution has been found, return an indication that no solution exists.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import heapq

def solve(stacks):
    costs = {0: 11, 1: 5, 2: 9, 3: 5, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 6, 7: 6, 8: 6, 9: 2}
    moves = {tuple(map(tuple, stacks)): (0, [])}
    queue = [(0, stacks)]

    while queue:
        cost, stacks = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks):
            return moves[tuple(map(tuple, stacks))][1]
        for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
            if stack:
                for j, target in enumerate(stacks):
                    if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == stack[-1]) and len(target) < 6:
                        new_stacks = [list(s) for s in stacks]
                        new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())
                        new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                        if tuple(map(tuple, new_stacks)) not in moves or moves[tuple(map(tuple, new_stacks))][0] > new_cost:
                            moves[tuple(map(tuple, new_stacks))] = (new_cost, moves[tuple(map(tuple, stacks))][1] + [(i, j)])
                            heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_stacks))
    return None
```

This script uses a dictionary `moves` to store the moves that led to each state and the total cost of the state. The dictionary is indexed by the state. The value is a tuple where the first element is the total cost of the state and the second element is the list of moves that led to the state.

The script uses a priority queue `queue` to store the states to be explored. The priority of a state is the total cost of the state. The state with the lowest cost is explored first.

The script uses a while loop to explore the states. In each iteration, it removes the state with the lowest cost from the queue and checks if it is a solution. If it is, it returns the moves that led to the solution. If it is not, it generates all possible moves from the state and adds the resulting states to the queue. If a state is reached that is already in the queue but with a higher cost, it updates the cost of the state in the queue. If a state is reached that is already in the queue but with a lower or equal cost, it ignores the state. If a state is reached that is not in the queue, it adds it to the queue.

If all states have been explored and no solution has been found, the script returns `None` to indicate that no solution exists.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The initial state is the starting node.
2. Create a queue and add the starting node to it.
3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue. For each possible move from this node, create a new node and add it to the queue. Keep track of the cost of each move and the total cost to reach each node.
4. When a node representing a sorted state is removed from the queue, return the moves that led to this node.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def get_moves(state, costs):
    moves = []

print(solve(initial_state, costs))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search to find the sequence of moves with the least cost that sorts the blocks. The `get_moves` function generates all possible moves from a given state. The `solve` function performs the breadth-first search. It uses a queue to keep track of the states to explore and a set to keep track of the states that have already been visited. It continues exploring states until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted, and then returns the sequence of moves that led to this state.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The edges between nodes represent a valid move of a block from one stack to another. The weight of the edge is the cost of the move.

2. Use a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. The goal state is the state where all stacks are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade.

3. The BFS algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to visit. It starts with the initial state and visits all its neighbors before moving on to the neighbors of the neighbors and so on. It keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits.

4. The BFS algorithm stops when it finds the goal state. The shortest path it found to the goal state is the solution to the problem.

print(bfs(initial_state, goal_state, costs))
```

Please note that this script assumes that the goal state is a state where each stack contains blocks of a single shade and the remaining stacks are empty. If the goal state is different, you need to adjust the goal_state variable accordingly.

This script first creates a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. It then enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost. If the state has been visited before, it is skipped. If all stacks in the state are sorted, the moves to reach this state are returned. Otherwise, all possible moves are tried and the new states are added to the queue with their corresponding costs. The moves are represented as tuples of the form (source stack, target stack).

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. Then, it enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If all stacks in this state are sorted, it returns the moves that led to this state. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and adds them to the queue with their corresponding costs. The moves are represented as tuples of the indices of the source and destination stacks. The script continues this process until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with an added cost function. It can be solved using a depth-first search algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The algorithm keeps track of the current state of the stacks and the total cost so far. It then generates all possible moves from the current state, calculates the cost for each move, and adds the moves to the priority queue. The algorithm continues until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted.

This script first converts the input stacks into tuples so they can be used in a set for visited states. It then starts a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost from the priority queue. If the state is the goal state, it returns the moves. If the state has been visited before, it continues with the next state. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the priority queue with their associated costs. The loop continues until it finds the goal state.

This script uses a priority queue to always explore the state with the lowest cost first. It also keeps track of the minimum cost to reach each state to avoid unnecessary computations. The script returns the list of moves that leads to all blocks being correctly sorted with the least possible cost.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

        if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks):
            return moves

This script works by maintaining a priority queue of states to process, where each state is a tuple containing the total cost of the moves made so far, the current configuration of the stacks, and the list of moves made so far. The queue is initialized with the initial state and cost 0. Then, while there are states to process, the script pops the state with the least cost from the queue, checks if all stacks are sorted, and if so, returns the moves made so far. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from the current state, calculates the cost of each move, and adds the new states to the queue. The process continues until a solution is found.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If all stacks in this state are sorted, it returns the moves that led to this state. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and adds them to the queue with their corresponding costs. The moves are represented as tuples of the indices of the source and destination stacks. The cost of a move is the cost of moving a block to the destination stack. The priority queue ensures that the states with the least cost are always explored first.

This problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present level before moving on to vertices at the next level.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Create a graph where each node represents a state of the stacks. The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack. The first element of each tuple is the color of the blocks in the stack, and the second element is the cost of moving a block to that stack.

2. Initialize the BFS queue with the initial state of the stacks and set the cost of the initial state to 0.

3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and for each possible move from this state, enqueue the new state with the cost of the move added to the current cost.

4. Keep track of the minimum cost and the moves that lead to it.

5. When all states have been explored, return the moves that lead to the minimum cost.

Here is the Python script that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    # Convert the stacks to a more convenient format
    stacks = [(list(reversed(stack)), i) for i, stack in enumerate(stacks)]

    # Initialize the minimum cost to infinity
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_moves = None
    while queue:
        stacks, moves, cost = queue.popleft()
        if cost >= min_cost:

        # Check if the stacks are sorted
        if all(len(set(stack[0])) <= 1 for stack in stacks):
            if cost < min_cost:
                min_cost = cost
                min_moves = moves
            continue
        # Try all possible moves
        for i, (stack, stack_index) in enumerate(stacks):
            if stack:

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 12, 1: 11, 2: 5, 3: 11, 4: 10, 5: 9, 6: 5, 7: 5, 8: 3, 9: 10, 10: 5, 11: 5}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue, checks if it is the goal state, and if not, generates all possible moves from that state, applies them to get new states, and pushes these new states into the queue with their corresponding costs and paths. The loop continues until it finds a goal state, at which point it returns the path to that state. The `is_goal` function checks if a state is a goal state by checking if all stacks contain blocks of only one color. The `get_moves` function generates all possible moves from a state by iterating over all stacks and checking if a block can be moved from one stack to another. The `apply_move` function applies a move to a state to get a new state.

This script first creates a dictionary to store the cost of moving a block to each stack. It then creates a priority queue to store the possible moves. The script then enters a while loop, where it pops the move with the least cost from the queue and checks if the resulting state has been visited before. If it has, it continues to the next iteration. If it hasn't, it adds the state to the visited set and checks if all stacks are sorted. If they are, it returns the moves. If they aren't, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the queue. The script continues this process until it finds a solution or the queue is empty.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python

print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty list of moves. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue. If this state has been visited before, it is skipped. If all stacks in this state are either empty or contain blocks of a single shade, the list of moves that led to this state is returned. Otherwise, for each stack, it tries to move the top block to each other stack that either is empty or contains blocks of the same shade. It then pushes the new state, the new list of moves, and the new cost to the queue. The loop continues until a solution is found or all states have been visited.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints. The solution involves using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves, while keeping track of the minimum cost. 

Here's a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
from collections import deque
from itertools import combinations

def min_cost_moves(stacks, costs):
    # Create a list of all colors
    colors = set(color for stack in stacks for color in stack)
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach a state
    min_costs = {tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks): 0}
    
    # Create a queue for BFS and add the initial state
    queue = deque([stacks])
    
    while queue:
        stacks = queue.popleft()
        for color in colors:
            # Find all stacks that contain the color at the top
            from_stacks = [i for i, stack in enumerate(stacks) if stack and stack[-1] == color]
            
            # Find all stacks that are either empty or contain the color
            to_stacks = [i for i, stack in enumerate(stacks) if not stack or stack[-1] == color]
            
            for from_stack, to_stack in combinations(from_stacks + to_stacks, 2):
                if from_stack in from_stacks and to_stack in to_stacks:
                    # Make a move
                    new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
                    new_stacks[to_stack].append(new_stacks[from_stack].pop())
                    
                    # Calculate the cost of the move
                    cost = min_costs[tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)] + costs[to_stack]
                    
                    # Convert the new state to a tuple for hashing
                    new_stacks_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_stacks)
                    
                    # If the new state has not been visited or the cost is lower, update the cost and add the state to the queue
                    if new_stacks_tuple not in min_costs or cost < min_costs[new_stacks_tuple]:
                        min_costs[new_stacks_tuple] = cost
                        queue.append(new_stacks)
    
    # Find the state with the minimum cost
    min_cost_state = min(min_costs, key=min_costs.get)
    
    # Return the minimum cost and the state
    return min_costs[min_cost_state], min_cost_state
```

This script first creates a list of all colors and a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach a state. It then uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves. For each move, it calculates the cost and updates the minimum cost if necessary. Finally, it returns the minimum cost and the state with the minimum cost.

Note: This script does not return the list of transfer pairs. To get the list of transfer pairs, you would need to modify the script to keep track of the moves that lead to each state.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty path. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue.

Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from this state and pushes them to the queue. The process continues until a solution is found or all states have been visited.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    # Initialize the priority queue with the initial state and cost 0
    queue = [(0, stacks, [])]

    # While there are states in the queue
    while queue:
        # Pop the state with the least cost
        cost, stacks, moves = heapq.heappop(queue)

        # If all stacks are sorted, return the moves
        if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks):
            return moves

        # For each pair of stacks
        for i in range(len(stacks)):
            for j in range(len(stacks)):
                # If the stacks are different and the first stack is not empty
                if i != j and stacks[i]:
                    # If the second stack is empty or the top block is the same color
                    if not stacks[j] or stacks[i][-1] == stacks[j][-1]:
                        # Copy the stacks and make the move
                        new_stacks = [list(stack) for stack in stacks]
                        new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())

                        # Calculate the new cost
                        new_cost = cost + costs[j]

                        # Add the new state to the queue
                        new_moves = list(moves)
                        new_moves.append((i, j))
                        heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_stacks, new_moves))

# Test the function

costs = {0: 10, 1: 7, 2: 7, 3: 7, 4: 9, 5: 3, 6: 8, 7: 5, 8: 4, 9: 10, 10: 7, 11: 7}
print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

This script works by exploring all possible moves from the current state, always selecting the move with the least cost. It continues this process until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted. It then returns the moves that led to this state.

Please note that this script may take a long time to run for large inputs, as it explores all possible moves.

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. Then, it enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost. If all stacks in the current state are sorted, it returns the moves that led to this state. Otherwise, it generates all possible moves from the current state and adds them to the queue with their respective costs. The script continues this process until it finds a solution or exhausts all possible states.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem, but with additional constraints and costs associated with each move. The problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, where each state of the stacks is a node in the graph, and each move is an edge connecting two nodes. The BFS algorithm will explore all possible moves from the current state, and keep track of the minimum cost to reach each state. The algorithm will stop when it finds a state where all stacks are sorted.

queue = deque([(stacks, [], 0)])
visited = set()

while queue:
    # Pop the current state, path and cost from the queue
    stacks, path, cost = queue.popleft()
    # Convert the current state to a tuple and check if it has been visited
    state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)
    if state in visited:
        continue
    visited.add(state)
    # Check if the current state is a goal state
    if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks):
        print(path)
        break
    # Generate all possible moves from the current state
    for i in range(12):
        if stacks[i]:
            for j in range(12):
                if i != j and (not stacks[j] or stacks[j][-1] == stacks[i][-1]) and len(stacks[j]) < 7:
                    # Make a copy of the current state and path
                    new_stacks = deepcopy(stacks)
                    new_path = path[:]
                    # Move a block from stack i to stack j
                    new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())
                    new_path.append((i, j))

                    queue.append((new_stacks, new_path, cost + costs[j]))
```

This script uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible states of the stacks. It keeps track of the minimum cost to reach each state, and stops when it finds a state where all stacks are sorted. The solution is a list of tuples, each containing the index of the stack from which a block is picked up and the index of the stack to which it is transferred.

This problem is a variant of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with additional constraints. It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue is used to always select the move with the least cost. The DFS algorithm is used to explore all possible moves.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python
import heapq

def restricted_sorting(stacks, costs):
    # Initialize the priority queue with the initial state and cost 0
    queue = [(0, stacks, [])]

    # Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        # Pop the state with the least cost
        cost, stacks, moves = heapq.heappop(queue)

        # Convert the state to a tuple to be able to store it in a set
        state = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)

        # If we have already visited this state, skip it
        if state in visited:
            continue

        # Mark the state as visited
        visited.add(state)

        # If all stacks are sorted, return the moves
        if all(len(set(stack)) <= 1 for stack in stacks if stack):
            return moves

        # Try all possible moves
        for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
            if stack:  # If the stack is not empty
                for j, target in enumerate(stacks):
                    if i != j and (not target or target[-1] == stack[-1]):  # If the target stack is empty or has the same color on top
                        # Make a copy of the stacks and the move
                        new_stacks = [list(s) for s in stacks]
                        new_stacks[j].append(new_stacks[i].pop())
                        new_moves = list(moves)
                        new_moves.append((i, j))

                        # Push the new state to the queue with the updated cost
                        new_cost = cost + costs[j]
                        heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, new_stacks, new_moves))

# Test the function
stacks = [[], ['Blue', 'Yellow', 'Pink', 'Green', 'Pink', 'Red', 'Red'], [], ['Pink', 'White', 'Pink', 'Black', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'White', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Pink', 'White', 'Blue', 'Red', 'White', 'Red'], [], [], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Green'], ['Yellow', 'Black', 'Black', 'White', 'Green', 'Green', 'Black'], [], []]
costs = {0: 10, 1: 8, 2: 6, 3: 4, 4: 11, 5: 5, 6: 11, 7: 5, 8: 7, 9: 7, 10: 10, 11: 10}
print(restricted_sorting(stacks, costs))
```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state and cost 0. It then enters a loop where it always selects the state with the least cost. For each state, it tries all possible moves and pushes the resulting states to the queue with their updated costs. The loop continues until it finds a state where all stacks are sorted, at which point it returns the moves that led to this state.

{'difficulty': 7, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 12 stacks each with a capacity of 7 blocks, with 6 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty. The challenge is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 6 blocks of a single shade. The player can only transfer one block at a time from the top of a stack to an empty stack or to a stack that has only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. Transferring blocks to certain stacks is more expensive than others. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 2, 1: 7, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 4, 5: 13, 6: 4, 7: 6, 8: 8, 9: 6, 10: 10, 11: 10}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0. The cost of moving a block is always at least 1. The solution should be a list of tuples, each containing, first, the index of the stack from which a block is picked up from and, second, the index of the stack to which it is transferred, indexing from 0.

```

This script first initializes a priority queue with the initial state of the stacks and an empty list of moves. It then enters a loop where it pops the state with the least cost from the queue and checks if it has been visited before. If it has, it continues to the next iteration. If it hasn't, it checks if the stacks are sorted. If they are, it returns the list of moves. If they aren't, it generates all possible moves from the current state and pushes them to the queue. The process repeats until a solution is found or all states have been visited.
