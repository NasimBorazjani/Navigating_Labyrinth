The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The blocks should be moved to the stacks with the least cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first non-empty stack (stack 3) and find the stack with the least cost that can accommodate the block on the top. In this case, the block on the top is 'Blue' and the stacks that can accommodate it are stack 0, 1, 2, and 4 with costs 5, 5, 3, and 5 respectively. So, the block is moved to stack 2 with the least cost. So, the first action is (3, 2).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 3) until it is empty. Each time, find the stack with the least cost that can accommodate the block on the top. The actions are (3, 2), (3, 2), (3, 2).

3. Move to the next non-empty stack (stack 4) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 0).

4. Move to the last non-empty stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1).

The final sequence of actions is [(3, 2), (3, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(3, 2), (3, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1)]

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, while minimizing the cost of the moves. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the first move is (0, 3).

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the next move is (0, 3).

3. The next block in stack 0 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the next move is (0, 5).

4. The last block in stack 0 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the next move is (0, 3).

5. Move to the next stack (stack 1). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the next move is (1, 5).

6. The next block in stack 1 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the next move is (1, 3).

7. The next block in stack 1 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the next move is (1, 3).

8. The last block in stack 1 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 1. So, the next move is (1, 3).

9. Move to the next stack (stack 3). The top block is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the next move is (3, 5).

10. The next block in stack 3 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 4 with a cost of 3. So, the next move is (3, 4).

11. The next block in stack 3 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 4 with a cost of 3. So, the next move is (3, 4).

12. The last block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 4 with a cost of 3. So, the next move is (3, 4).

The initial state of the stacks is as follows:

Stack 0: []
Stack 1: ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red']
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Green', 'Red', 'Green']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Blue']
Stack 4: []
Stack 5: []

The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 5, 3: 6, 4: 1, 5: 1}. 

We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always move the top block of a stack to the stack with the lowest cost that can accept it. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Move the top block of stack 1 ('Yellow') to stack 4. The cost is 1. 
2. Move the top block of stack 1 ('Green') to stack 5. The cost is 1.
3. Move the top block of stack 1 ('Red') to stack 0. The cost is 3.
4. Move the top block of stack 1 ('Red') to stack 0. The cost is 3.
5. Move the top block of stack 2 ('Blue') to stack 4. The cost is 1.
6. Move the top block of stack 2 ('Green') to stack 5. The cost is 1.
7. Move the top block of stack 2 ('Red') to stack 0. The cost is 3.
8. Move the top block of stack 2 ('Green') to stack 5. The cost is 1.
9. Move the top block of stack 3 ('Yellow') to stack 4. The cost is 1.
10. Move the top block of stack 3 ('Blue') to stack 4. The cost is 1.
11. Move the top block of stack 3 ('Yellow') to stack 4. The cost is 1.
12. Move the top block of stack 3 ('Blue') to stack 4. The cost is 1.

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 4), (3, 4), (3, 4)].

The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade.

The initial state of the stacks is [['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Blue', 'Green'], [], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], [], []].

Step 1: Move the 'Green' block from stack 0 to stack 1. The cost is 3. The state of the stacks is [['Yellow', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], [], []].

Step 2: Move the 'Blue' block from stack 0 to stack 4. The cost is 1. The state of the stacks is [['Yellow', 'Blue'], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], ['Blue'], []].

Step 4: Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 0 to stack 5. The cost is 3. The state of the stacks is [[], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue'], ['Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow']].

Step 5: Move the 'Blue' block from stack 3 to stack 4. The cost is 1. The state of the stacks is [[], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow'], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow']].

Step 6: Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 3 to stack 5. The cost is 3. The state of the stacks is [[], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green', 'Red'], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow']].

Step 7: Move the 'Red' block from stack 3 to stack 2. The cost is 5. The state of the stacks is [[], ['Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red', 'Red'], ['Green'], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow']].

Step 8: Move the 'Green' block from stack 3 to stack 1. The cost is 3. The state of the stacks is [[], ['Green', 'Green'], ['Yellow', 'Green', 'Red', 'Red', 'Red'], [], ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue'], ['Yellow', 'Yellow']].

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is correct!! LLM solution is NOT optimal 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the stack at index 3. The top block is 'Yellow'. Move it to the empty stack at index 0. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (3, 0).

2. The next block in stack 3 is 'Green'. Move it to the empty stack at index 1. The cost of this move is 3. The action is (3, 1).

3. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. Move it to the empty stack at index 2. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (3, 2).

4. The next block in stack 3 is also 'Blue'. Move it to stack 2 which already has a 'Blue' block. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (3, 2).

5. Move to the next stack at index 4. The top block is 'Red'. Move it to the empty stack at index 3. The cost of this move is 6. The action is (4, 3).

6. The next block in stack 4 is 'Blue'. Move it to stack 2 which already has 'Blue' blocks. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (4, 2).

7. The next block in stack 4 is 'Green'. Move it to stack 1 which already has a 'Green' block. The cost of this move is 3. The action is (4, 1).

8. The next block in stack 4 is also 'Green'. Move it to stack 1 which already has 'Green' blocks. The cost of this move is 3. The action is (4, 1).

9. Move to the next stack at index 5. The top block is 'Red'. Move it to stack 3 which already has a 'Red' block. The cost of this move is 6. The action is (5, 3).

10. The next block in stack 5 is also 'Red'. Move it to stack 3 which already has 'Red' blocks. The cost of this move is 6. The action is (5, 3).

11. The next block in stack 5 is 'Yellow'. Move it to stack 0 which already has a 'Yellow' block. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (5, 0).

12. The next block in stack 5 is also 'Yellow'. Move it to stack 0 which already has 'Yellow' blocks. The cost of this move is 5. The action is (5, 0).

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 0), (5, 0)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 0), (5, 0)]

The strategy is to move the blocks to the cheapest available stack that either contains blocks of the same shade or is empty. 

Step 1: Move the 'Green' block from Stack 2 to Stack 0. The cost is 1.

Stack 0: ['Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Green', 'Red', 'Green', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 2: Move the 'Green' block from Stack 4 to Stack 0. The cost is 1.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Red', 'Green', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 3: Move the 'Green' block from Stack 4 to Stack 0. The cost is 1.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Red', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 4: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 4 to Stack 5. The cost is 5.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow']
Stack 5: ['Red']

Step 5: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 3 to Stack 5. The cost is 5.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow']
Stack 5: ['Red', 'Red']

Step 6: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 3 to Stack 5. The cost is 5.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 4: ['Yellow']
Stack 5: ['Red', 'Red', 'Red']

Step 7: Move the 'Yellow' block from Stack 3 to Stack 1. The cost is 7.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: ['Yellow']
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: ['Yellow']
Stack 4: ['Yellow']
Stack 5: ['Red', 'Red', 'Red']

Step 8: Move the 'Yellow' block from Stack 3 to Stack 1. The cost is 7.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: ['Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: []
Stack 4: ['Yellow']
Stack 5: ['Red', 'Red', 'Red']

Step 9: Move the 'Yellow' block from Stack 4 to Stack 1. The cost is 7.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 2: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 3: []
Stack 4: []
Stack 5: ['Red', 'Red', 'Red']

Step 10: Move the 'Blue' block from Stack 2 to Stack 3. The cost is 4.

Stack 0: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 1: ['Yellow

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The blocks should be moved to the stack with the least cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 1 to stack 0. The cost of moving one block to stack 0 is 3. So, the first action is (1, 0).

2. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 1 to stack 0. The cost of moving one block to stack 0 is 3. So, the second action is (1, 0).

3. Move the 'Green' block from stack 1 to stack 2. The cost of moving one block to stack 2 is 1. So, the third action is (1, 2).

4. Move the 'Red' block from stack 1 to stack 5. The cost of moving one block to stack 5 is 4. So, the fourth action is (1, 5).

5. Move the 'Green' block from stack 3 to stack 2. The cost of moving one block to stack 2 is 1. So, the fifth action is (3, 2).

6. Move the 'Red' block from stack 3 to stack 5. The cost of moving one block to stack 5 is 4. So, the sixth action is (3, 5).

7. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 3 to stack 4. The cost of moving one block to stack 4 is 7. So, the seventh action is (3, 4).

8. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 3 to stack 4. The cost of moving one block to stack 4 is 7. So, the eighth action is (3, 4).

9. Move the 'Green' block from stack 5 to stack 2. The cost of moving one block to stack 2 is 1. So, the ninth action is (5, 2).

10. Move the 'Red' block from stack 5 to stack 1. The cost of moving one block to stack 1 is 5. So, the tenth action is (5, 1).

11. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 5 to stack 0. The cost of moving one block to stack 0 is 3. So, the eleventh action is (5, 0).

12. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 5 to stack 4. The cost of moving one block to stack 4 is 7. So, the twelfth action is (5, 4).

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(1, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 4)].

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The blocks should be moved to the stacks with the least cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Move the 'Red' block from stack 3 to stack 0. The cost is 4.
2. Move the 'Green' block from stack 3 to stack 1. The cost is 5.
3. Move the 'Green' block from stack 3 to stack 1. The cost is 5.
4. Move the 'Red' block from stack 3 to stack 0. The cost is 4.
5. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 4 to stack 2. The cost is 5.
6. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 4 to stack 3. The cost is 2.
7. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 4 to stack 2. The cost is 5.
8. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 4 to stack 3. The cost is 2.
9. Move the 'Yellow' block from stack 5 to stack 4. The cost is 5.
10. Move the 'Green' block from stack 5 to stack 1. The cost is 5.
11. Move the 'Red' block from stack 5 to stack 0. The cost is 4.
12. Move the 'Blue' block from stack 5 to stack 3. The cost is 2.

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3)].

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is correct!! LLM solution is NOT optimal 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, while minimizing the cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the stack at index 2. The top block is 'Green'. Move it to the empty stack at index 0. The cost is 2. The action is (2, 0).

2. Move the next block 'Blue' from stack 2 to the empty stack at index 1. The cost is 4. The action is (2, 1).

3. Move the next block 'Green' from stack 2 to stack 0. The cost is 2. The action is (2, 0).

4. Move the last block 'Yellow' from stack 2 to the empty stack at index 3. The cost is 6. The action is (2, 3).

5. Move to the next stack at index 4. The top block is 'Red'. Move it to the empty stack at index 2. The cost is 6. The action is (4, 2).

6. Move the next block 'Red' from stack 4 to stack 2. The cost is 6. The action is (4, 2).

7. Move the next block 'Yellow' from stack 4 to stack 3. The cost is 6. The action is (4, 3).

8. Move the last block 'Blue' from stack 4 to stack 1. The cost is 4. The action is (4, 1).

9. Move to the last stack at index 5. The top block is 'Green'. Move it to stack 0. The cost is 2. The action is (5, 0).

10. Move the next block 'Red' from stack 5 to stack 2. The cost is 6. The action is (5, 2).

11. Move the next block 'Blue' from stack 5 to stack 1. The cost is 4. The action is (5, 1).

12. Move the last block 'Yellow' from stack 5 to stack 3. The cost is 6. The action is (5, 3).

The initial state of the stacks is as follows:

Stack 0: []
Stack 1: ['Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue']
Stack 2: []
Stack 3: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green']
Stack 4: ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Green']
Stack 5: []

The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 4, 5: 1}. 

We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always move the top block from a stack to the stack with the lowest cost that can accept it. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Move the top block ('Green') from Stack 1 to Stack 5. The cost is 1. 
2. Move the top block ('Red') from Stack 1 to Stack 0. The cost is 4.
3. Move the top block ('Yellow') from Stack 1 to Stack 2. The cost is 5.
4. Move the top block ('Blue') from Stack 1 to Stack 3. The cost is 2.
5. Move the top block ('Red') from Stack 3 to Stack 0. The cost is 4.
6. Move the top block ('Blue') from Stack 3 to Stack 1. The cost is 2.
7. Move the top block ('Yellow') from Stack 3 to Stack 2. The cost is 5.
8. Move the top block ('Green') from Stack 3 to Stack 5. The cost is 1.
9. Move the top block ('Red') from Stack 4 to Stack 0. The cost is 4.
10. Move the top block ('Yellow') from Stack 4 to Stack 2. The cost is 5.
11. Move the top block ('Blue') from Stack 4 to Stack 1. The cost is 2.
12. Move the top block ('Green') from Stack 4 to Stack 5. The cost is 1.

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 5)].

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, without exceeding the stacks’ capacity. The blocks should be moved in such a way that the total cost of moving the blocks is minimized. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0) and move the top block ('Red') to the first empty stack (stack 1) with a cost of 5. The action is (0, 1).

2. Move the next block ('Yellow') from stack 0 to the next empty stack (stack 2) with a cost of 3. The action is (0, 2).

3. Move the next block ('Blue') from stack 0 to the next empty stack (stack 3) with a cost of 3. The action is (0, 3).

4. Move the last block ('Yellow') from stack 0 to stack 2 which already has a 'Yellow' block with a cost of 3. The action is (0, 2).

5. Move to the next filled stack (stack 3) and move the top block ('Green') to the next empty stack (stack 4) with a cost of 3. The action is (3, 4).

6. Move the next block ('Blue') from stack 3 to stack 3 which already has a 'Blue' block with a cost of 3. The action is (3, 3).

7. Move the next block ('Green') from stack 3 to stack 4 which already has a 'Green' block with a cost of 3. The action is (3, 4).

8. Move the last block ('Red') from stack 3 to stack 1 which already has a 'Red' block with a cost of 5. The action is (3, 1).

9. Move to the last filled stack (stack 5) and move the top block ('Yellow') to stack 2 which already has 'Yellow' blocks with a cost of 3. The action is (5, 2).

10. Move the next block ('Red') from stack 5 to stack 1 which already has 'Red' blocks with a cost of 5. The action is (5, 1).

11. Move the next block ('Green') from stack 5 to stack 4 which already has 'Green' blocks with a cost of 3. The action is (5, 4).

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the top block of the third stack (index 2), which is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the first action is (2, 0).

2. The next block in the third stack is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the second action is (2, 1).

3. The next block in the third stack is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the third action is (2, 0).

4. The last block in the third stack is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the fourth action is (2, 1).

5. Now, we move to the fourth stack (index 3). The top block is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the fifth action is (3, 0).

6. The next block in the fourth stack is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the sixth action is (3, 1).

7. The next block in the fourth stack is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the seventh action is (3, 0).

8. The last block in the fourth stack is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the eighth action is (3, 1).

9. Now, we move to the sixth stack (index 5). The top block is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the ninth action is (5, 0).

10. The next block in the sixth stack is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the tenth action is (5, 1).

11. The next block in the sixth stack is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the second stack (index 1), with a cost of 1. So, the eleventh action is (5, 1).

12. The last block in the sixth stack is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is the first stack (index 0), with a cost of 5. So, the twelfth action is (5, 0).

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0)].

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 1) and find the block at the top of the stack, which is 'Green'. The cost of moving a block to the top of each stack is: {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 2, 5: 5}. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 4. So, the first action is (1, 4).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 1) until it is empty. Each time, find the cheapest stack that can be used to move the block to. The actions are (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4).

3. Move to the next stack (stack 2) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 4).

4. Now, all the blocks are in the correct stacks but they are not sorted by shade. To sort the blocks by shade, we need to move the blocks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade. The actions are (4, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 5), (0, 5), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 3).

{'difficulty': 4, 'statement': "In 'Restricted Sorting', there are 6 stacks each with a capacity of 4 blocks, with 3 stacks filled with blocks of varying shades and the remaining are empty.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
The initial state of the stacks is as follows:

Stack 0: []
Stack 1: ['Blue', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Red']
Stack 2: []
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Blue']
Stack 5: []

The goal is to sort the blocks by shade such that if a stack is not empty, it is stacked with 3 blocks of a single shade. The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}. 

We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the move with the least cost that brings us closer to the goal state. 

Step 1: Move the 'Blue' block from Stack 1 to Stack 0. This move costs 3. 

Stack 0: ['Blue']
Stack 1: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Red']
Stack 2: []
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Blue']
Stack 5: []

Step 2: Move the 'Blue' block from Stack 1 to Stack 0. This move costs 3. 

Stack 0: ['Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 1: ['Red', 'Red']
Stack 2: []
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Blue']
Stack 5: []

Step 3: Move the 'Blue' block from Stack 4 to Stack 0. This move costs 3. 

Stack 0: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 1: ['Red', 'Red']
Stack 2: []
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 4: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 1 to Stack 2. This move costs 3. 

Stack 0: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 1: ['Red']
Stack 2: ['Red']
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 5: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 1 to Stack 2. This move costs 3. 

Stack 0: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Red', 'Red']
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green', 'Red']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

Step 6: Move the 'Red' block from Stack 3 to Stack 2. This move costs 2. 

Stack 0: ['Blue', 'Blue', 'Blue']
Stack 1: []
Stack 2: ['Red', 'Red', 'Red']
Stack 3: ['Green', 'Green', 'Green']
Stack 4: ['Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow']
Stack 5: []

So, the list of transfer pairs with the least possible cost, that will result in all the blocks being correctly sorted is [(1, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (1, 2), (1, 2), (3, 2)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(1, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (1, 2), (1, 2), (3, 2)]

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack that is not empty (stack 2) and find the cheapest stack that is empty or has only blocks of the same shade as the top block of stack 2. In this case, the cheapest stack that can be used is stack 2 itself. So, the first action is (2, 2).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 2) until it is empty. Each time, find the cheapest stack that is empty or has only blocks of the same shade as the top block of stack 2. The actions are (2, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0).

3. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 1).

4. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 4) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 1).

5. Move to the last stack that is not empty (stack 7) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 1).

The cost of moving one block to the top of each stack is: {0: 6, 1: 3, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 8, 5: 3, 6: 8, 7: 5}, where the keys are the index of each stack, indexing from 0.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 1) and find the block at the top of the stack, which is 'Yellow'. The cost of moving a block to the top of each stack is given. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 2. So, the first action is (1, 3).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 1) until it is empty or until the block at the top of the stack is of a different shade. The actions are (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3).

3. Move to the next stack (stack 2) and repeat the process until the stack is empty or until the block at the top of the stack is of a different shade. The actions are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 1).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty or until the block at the top of the stack is of a different shade. The actions are (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3).

5. Move to the next stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty or until the block at the top of the stack is of a different shade. The actions are (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 0), (5, 3).

6. Now, all the blocks are correctly sorted in the stacks. However, some stacks have less than 4 blocks. To minimize the cost, we should move the blocks from the stacks with higher cost to the stacks with lower cost. The actions are (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1).

The final sequence of actions is [(1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 0), (5, 3), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1)].

The answer is /answer_list/[(1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 0), (5, 3), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1)]

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 3 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (0, 3).

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the stack at index 3. The top block is 'Yellow'. Move it to the empty stack at index 0 with a cost of 2. The action is (3, 0).

2. The top block in stack 3 is now 'Black'. Move it to the empty stack at index 1 with a cost of 1. The action is (3, 1).

3. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 3) until it is empty. The actions are (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'Red'. Move it to the empty stack at index 2 with a cost of 6. The action is (4, 2).

5. The top block in stack 4 is now 'Yellow'. Move it to the stack at index 0 with a cost of 2. The action is (4, 0).

6. The top block in stack 4 is now 'Blue'. Move it to the empty stack at index 5 with a cost of 5. The action is (4, 5).

7. The top block in stack 4 is now 'Black'. Move it to the stack at index 1 with a cost of 1. The action is (4, 1).

8. The top block in stack 4 is now 'Black'. Move it to the stack at index 1 with a cost of 1. The action is (4, 1).

9. Move to the next stack (stack 6). The top block is 'Red'. Move it to the stack at index 2 with a cost of 6. The action is (6, 2).

10. The top block in stack 6 is now 'Blue'. Move it to the stack at index 5 with a cost of 5. The action is (6, 5).

11. The top block in stack 6 is now 'Green'. Move it to the empty stack at index 4 with a cost of 1. The action is (6, 4).

12. The top block in stack 6 is now 'Red'. Move it to the stack at index 2 with a cost of 6. The action is (6, 2).

13. The top block in stack 6 is now 'Blue'. Move it to the stack at index 5 with a cost of 5. The action is (6, 5).

14. Move to the last stack (stack 7). The top block is 'Green'. Move it to the stack at index 4 with a cost of 1. The action is (7, 4).

15. The top block in stack 7 is now 'Blue'. Move it to the stack at index 5 with a cost of 5. The action is (7, 5).

16. The top block in stack 7 is now 'Red'. Move it to the stack at index 2 with a cost of 6. The action is (7, 2).

17. The top block in stack 7 is now 'Yellow'. Move it to the stack at index 0 with a cost of 2. The action is (7, 0).

18. The top block in stack 7 is now 'Green'. Move it to the stack at index 4 with a cost of 1. The action is (7, 4).

The final sequence of actions is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 0), (7, 4)].

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack that is not empty (stack 2) and find the block at the top of the stack (Blue). Find the stack with the least cost to move the block to. In this case, the stack with the least cost is stack 0. So, the first action is (2, 0).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 2) until it is empty. Each time, find the stack with the least cost to move the block to. The actions are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1).

3. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0).

4. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1).

5. Move to the last stack that is not empty (stack 6) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0).

The final sequence of actions is [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0)].

4. Move to the next non-empty stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the block at the top of the stack is not 'Blue'. There are no 'Blue' blocks in stack 5, so no actions are taken.

5. Move to the last non-empty stack (stack 7) and repeat the process until the block at the top of the stack is not 'Blue'. The actions are to move the 'Blue' block to stack 0. The cost of these actions is 6.

7. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 4 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (3, 4).

8. The next block in stack 3 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 0 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (3, 0).

9. The next block in stack 3 is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 0 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (3, 0).

10. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top three blocks are 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move these blocks to is stack 0 with a cost of 2 each. So, the next three actions are (4, 0), (4, 0), and (4, 0).

11. The next block in stack 4 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 1 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (4, 1).

14. The next two blocks in stack 7 are 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move these blocks to is stack 0 with a cost of 2 each. So, the next two actions are (7, 0) and (7, 0).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 1. So, the first action is (0, 1).

8. The next two blocks in stack 2 are 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move these blocks to is stack 5. So, the next two actions are (2, 5) and (2, 5).

9. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 2. So, the next action is (4, 2).

14. Move to the last stack (stack 7). The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5. So, the next action is (7, 5).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first non-empty stack (stack 2) and pick up the top block (Green). Move it to the first empty stack (stack 0) with a cost of 7. So, the first action is (2, 0).

2. Move to the next block in the same stack (stack 2) and pick up the top block (Red). Move it to the next empty stack (stack 1) with a cost of 11. So, the next action is (2, 1).

3. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 2) until it is empty. Each time, find the empty stack or the stack that has only blocks of that shade with the least cost. The actions are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0).

4. Move to the next non-empty stack (stack 4) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1).

5. Move to the next non-empty stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 5), (5, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 0).

6. Move to the next non-empty stack (stack 8) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5).

7. Move to the last non-empty stack (stack 9) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 3).

The final sequence of actions is [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 1), (5, 5), (5, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 0), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 3)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the stacks with the highest cost to the stacks with the lowest cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the stack with the highest cost, which is stack 1 or 6. Since stack 1 is empty, we start with stack 6. The top block in stack 6 is 'Red'. We move it to the stack with the lowest cost that is either empty or contains only 'Red' blocks. In this case, the stack with the lowest cost is stack 3. So, the first action is (6, 3).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 6) until it is empty. Each time, find the stack with the lowest cost that is either empty or contains only blocks of the same shade as the top block in stack 6. The actions are (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 3).

3. Move to the next stack with the highest cost, which is stack 1. Since stack 1 is still empty, we move to the next stack with the highest cost, which is stack 2. The top block in stack 2 is 'Blue'.

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the stack at index 2. The top block is 'Blue'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 8 with a cost of 4. So, the first action is (2, 8).

2. The next block in stack 2 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 0 with a cost of 7. So, the next action is (2, 0).

3. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 2. The actions are (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 3). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 7 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (3, 7).

5. The next block in stack 3 is 'Red'. It can be moved to stack 7 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (3, 7).

6. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. It can be moved to stack 8 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (3, 8).

7. The next block in stack 3 is 'White'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 9 with a cost of 8. So, the next action is (3, 9).

8. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. It can be moved to stack 8 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (3, 8).

9. The next block in stack 3 is 'Black'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 6 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (3, 6).

10. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'White'. It can be moved to stack 9 with a cost of 8. So, the next action is (4, 9).

11. The next block in stack 4 is 'Green'. The cheapest empty stack is at index 5 with a cost of 10. So, the next action is (4, 5).

12. The next block in stack 4 is 'Red'. It can be moved to stack 7 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (4, 7).

13. The next block in stack 4 is 'Black'. It can be moved to stack 6 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (4, 6).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, starting from the stack with the least cost. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'White'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5. So, the first action is (0, 5).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 0) until it is empty. Each time, find the cheapest stack that can accept the block. The actions are (0, 5), (0, 5), (0, 5), (0, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6).

3. Move to the next stack (stack 2) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (2, 5), (2, 5), (2, 5), (2, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6).

6. Now, all the blocks are sorted by shade in the stacks with the least cost.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack that is not empty (stack 2) and find the stack with the least cost that can receive the block from the top of stack 2. In this case, the block on the top of stack 2 is 'White' and the stack with the least cost that can receive it is stack 0. So, the first action is (2, 0).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 2) until it is empty. Each time, find the stack with the least cost that can receive the block from the top of stack 2. The actions are (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8).

3. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 9).

4. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 0).

5. Move to the next stack that is not empty (stack 7) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (7, 8), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6).

6. Move to the last stack that is not empty (stack 9) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 9), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8).

The final sequence of actions is [(2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 9), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 0), (7, 8), (7, 4), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 9), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)].

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always move the block that costs the least to move to a stack where it can be placed. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the topmost block in the second stack (index 1), which is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack where it can be placed is the first stack (index 0) with a cost of 5. So, the first action is (1, 0).

2. The next block in the second stack is 'Black'. The cheapest stack where it can be placed is the first stack (index 0) with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (1, 0).

3. The next block in the second stack is also 'Black'. It can be placed in the first stack (index 0) with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (1, 0).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 2) and find the block at the top, which is 'White'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 1 with a cost of 1. So, the first action is (2, 1).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 2) until it is empty. Each time, find the cheapest stack that can accept the block at the top. The actions are (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 0).

3. Move to the next stack (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 6).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 4) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 0).

5. Move to the next stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 1).

6. Move to the last stack (stack 6) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 1).

The final sequence of actions is [(2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 1)].

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, while minimizing the cost of moving the blocks. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

6. Move to the next stack (stack 8). The top block is 'White'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is the stack at index 0, but it contains 'Blue' blocks. So, we move the block to the next cheapest empty stack, which is the stack at index 9. So, the action is (8, 9).

7. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 8) until all 'White' blocks are moved to stack 9. The actions are (8, 9), (8, 9).

8. Move to the next stack (stack 9). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is the stack at index 0, but it contains 'Blue' blocks. So, we move the block to the next cheapest stack that contains 'Red' blocks, which is the stack at index 6. So, the action is (9, 6).

10. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is the stack at index 0, but it contains 'Blue' blocks. So, we move the block to the next cheapest empty stack, which is the stack at index 1. So, the action is (4, 1).

11. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 4) until all 'Black' blocks are moved to stack 1. The action is (4, 1).

12. Move to the next stack (stack 5). The top block is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is the stack at index 0, but it contains 'Blue' blocks. So, we move the block to the next cheapest empty stack, which is the stack at index 3. So, the action is (5, 3).

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always move the top block of a stack to the stack with the lowest cost that can accept it. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (index 0). The top block is 'Black'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the first action is (0, 5).

2. The top block of the first stack is now 'Red'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the second action is (0, 5).

3. The top block of the first stack is now 'Black'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the third action is (0, 5).

4. The top block of the first stack is now 'Green'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the fourth action is (0, 5).

5. The top block of the first stack is now 'Blue'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the fifth action is (0, 5).

6. The top block of the first stack is now 'Yellow'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the sixth action is (0, 5).

7. The first stack is now empty. Move to the second stack (index 1). The top block is 'Yellow'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the seventh action is (1, 5).

8. The top block of the second stack is now 'Yellow'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the eighth action is (1, 5).

9. The top block of the second stack is now 'Black'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the ninth action is (1, 5).

10. The top block of the second stack is now 'Blue'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the tenth action is (1, 5).

11. The top block of the second stack is now 'Red'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the eleventh action is (1, 5).

12. The top block of the second stack is now 'Green'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the twelfth action is (1, 5).

13. The second stack is now empty. Move to the seventh stack (index 6). The top block is 'Yellow'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the thirteenth action is (6, 5).

14. The top block of the seventh stack is now 'Black'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the fourteenth action is (6, 5).

15. The top block of the seventh stack is now 'White'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the fifteenth action is (6, 5).

16. The top block of the seventh stack is now 'Yellow'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the sixteenth action is (6, 5).

17. The top block of the seventh stack is now 'Red'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the seventeenth action is (6, 5).

18. The top block of the seventh stack is now 'Black'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the eighteenth action is (6, 5).

19. The seventh stack is now empty. Move to the eighth stack (index 7). The top block is 'Green'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the nineteenth action is (7, 5).

20. The top block of the eighth stack is now 'Blue'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the twentieth action is (7, 5).

21. The top block of the eighth stack is now 'Green'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the twenty-first action is (7, 5).

22. The top block of the eighth stack is now 'White'. The stack with the lowest cost that can accept it is stack 5. So, the twenty-second action is (7, 5).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack. The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the first action is (0, 5).

2. The next block in the first stack is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. But stack 5 already has a 'Black' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 0 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 0).

3. The next block in the first stack is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. But stack 5 already has a 'Black' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 0 with a cost of 3. But stack 0 already has a 'Blue' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 6 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 6).

4. The next block in the first stack is 'White'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. But stack 5 already has a 'Black' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 0 with a cost of 3. But stack 0 already has a 'Blue' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 6 with a cost of 3. But stack 6 already has a 'Red' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 9 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 9).

5. The next block in the first stack is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. But stack 5 already has a 'Black' block. So, we need to find the next cheapest stack which is stack 6 with a cost of 3. Stack 6 already has a 'Red' block. So, the next action is (0, 6).

6. The next block in the first stack is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (0, 5).

7. Repeat the process for the remaining stacks until all the blocks are correctly sorted.

The final sequence of actions is [(0, 5), (0, 0), (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 9), (2, 9), (2, 9), (2, 9), (5, 9), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 9), (7, 0), (7, 0), (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 9)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 3. So, the first action is (0, 3).

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 3. But stack 3 already has a 'Black' block, so we can't move the 'Blue' block there. The next cheapest stack is stack 4 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (0, 4).

3. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 0. The actions are (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 5).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 2) and repeat the process until all the blocks in the stack are moved. The actions are (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5).

5. Repeat the process for the remaining stacks. The actions for stack 5 are (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3). The actions for stack 6 are (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 3). The actions for stack 7 are (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5). The actions for stack 10 are (10, 5), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 3), (10, 5).

The final sequence of actions is [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (10, 5), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 3), (10, 5), (10, 3), (10, 5)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5 with a cost of 3. So, the first action is (0, 5).

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 11 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (0, 11).

3. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 0. The actions are (0, 11), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 11).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 2). The top block is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 9 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (2, 9).

5. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 2. The actions are (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1).

6. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 9 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (4, 9).

7. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 4. The actions are (4, 1), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 5).

8. Move to the next stack (stack 5). The top block is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 11 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (5, 11).

9. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 5. The actions are (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 9).

10. Move to the next stack (stack 7). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 5 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (7, 5).

11. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 7. The actions are (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5).

12. Move to the next stack (stack 10). The top block is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 1 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (10, 1).

13. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in stack 10. The actions are (10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 1), (10, 5), (10, 1), (10, 11).

The final sequence of actions is [(0, 5), (0, 11), (0, 11), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 11), (2, 9), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 5), (5, 11), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 9), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5), (10, 1), (10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 1), (10, 5), (10, 1), (10, 11)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always move the top block of a stack to the stack with the lowest cost that can accept it. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Red'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the first action is (0, 6).

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Black'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (0, 6).

3. The next block in stack 0 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (0, 6).

4. The next block in stack 0 is 'Black'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (0, 6).

7. The next block in stack 0 is 'White'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (0, 6).

8. Move to the next stack (stack 2). The top block is 'White'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

9. The next block in stack 2 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

10. The next block in stack 2 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

11. The next block in stack 2 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

12. The next block in stack 2 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

13. The next block in stack 2 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

14. The next block in stack 2 is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (2, 6).

15. Move to the next stack (stack 3). The top block is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (3, 6).

16. The next block in stack 3 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (3, 6).

20. The next block in stack 3 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (3, 6).

21. The next block in stack 3 is 'White'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (3, 6).

22. Move to the next stack (stack 5). The top block is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (5, 6).

23. The next block in stack 5 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack that can accept it is stack 6. So, the next action is (5, 6).

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack that is not empty, which is stack 1. The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack to move the block to is stack 3 with a cost of 3. So, the first action is (1, 3).

2. Repeat the process for the same stack (stack 1) until it is empty. Each time, find the cheapest stack that can accept the block. The actions are (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3).

3. Move to the next stack (stack 3) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3).

4. Move to the next stack (stack 5) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 3).

5. Move to the next stack (stack 6) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3).

6. Move to the next stack (stack 7) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (7, 3), (7, 3), (7, 3), (7, 3), (7, 3), (7, 3).

7. Move to the last stack (stack 9) and repeat the process until the stack is empty. The actions are (9, 3), (9, 3), (9, 3), (9, 3), (9, 3), (9, 3).

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of that shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack (stack 0). The top block is 'Pink'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 1 with a cost of 5. So, the first action is (0, 1).

2. The next block in stack 0 is 'Red'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 2 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (0, 2).

3. The next block in stack 0 is 'Black'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 6 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 6).

4. The next block in stack 0 is 'Green'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 7 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (0, 7).

5. The next block in stack 0 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 10 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 10).

6. The next block in stack 0 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack with 'Yellow' blocks is stack 10 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (0, 10).

7. The next block in stack 0 is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack with 'Pink' blocks is stack 1 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (0, 1).

8. Move to the next stack (stack 3). The top block is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack with 'Pink' blocks is stack 1 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (3, 1).

9. The next block in stack 3 is 'White'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 11 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (3, 11).

10. The next block in stack 3 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack with 'Yellow' blocks is stack 10 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (3, 10).

11. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. The cheapest empty stack is stack 5 with a cost of 9. So, the next action is (3, 5).

12. The next block in stack 3 is 'Green'. The cheapest stack with 'Green' blocks is stack 7 with a cost of 2. So, the next action is (3, 7).

13. The next block in stack 3 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack with 'Blue' blocks is stack 5 with a cost of 9. So, the next action is (3, 5).

14. The next block in stack 3 is 'Black'. The cheapest stack with 'Black' blocks is stack 6 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (3, 6).

15. Move to the next stack (stack 4). The top block is 'Black'. The cheapest stack with 'Black' blocks is stack 6 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (4, 6).

16. The next block in stack 4 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack with 'Blue' blocks is stack 5 with a cost of 9. So, the next action is (4, 5).

17. The next block in stack 4 is 'Red'. The cheapest stack with 'Red' blocks is stack 2 with a cost of 4. So, the next action is (4, 2).

18. The next block in stack 4 is 'Pink'. The cheapest stack with 'Pink' blocks is stack 1 with a cost of 5. So, the next action is (4, 1).

19. The next block in stack 4 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack with 'Yellow' blocks is stack 10 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (4, 10).

20. The next block in stack 4 is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack with 'Yellow' blocks is stack 10 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (4, 10).

21. The next block in stack 4 is 'Blue'. The cheapest stack with 'Blue' blocks is stack 5 with a cost of 9. So, the next action is (4, 5).

22. Move to the next stack (stack 6). The top block is 'White'. The cheapest stack with 'White' blocks

The problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start moving the blocks from the top of the stacks to the empty stacks or to the stacks that have only blocks of the same shade, choosing the stack with the least cost each time. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first stack. The top block is 'Yellow'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. So, the first action is (0, 5).

2. The next block in the first stack is 'Green'. The cheapest stack to move this block to is stack 5 with a cost of 2. But stack 5 already has a 'Yellow' block. So, we need to move the 'Yellow' block from stack 5 to another stack before we can move the 'Green' block to stack 5. The cheapest stack to move the 'Yellow' block to is stack 11 with a cost of 3. So, the next action is (5, 11).

3. Now we can move the 'Green' block from the first stack to stack 5. So, the next action is (0, 5).

4. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks in the first stack. The actions are (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1).

5. Move to the next stack and repeat the process until all the blocks are correctly sorted. The final sequence of actions is [(0, 5), (5, 11), (0, 5), (0, 11), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 11), (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 5), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 11), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 11), (3, 5), (3, 5), (3, 3), (3, 11), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 5), (4, 11), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 5), (8, 5), (8, 11), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 11), (8, 1), (8, 5)].

4. Move the next block (White) from stack 0 to the next empty stack (stack 4). The cost of this move is 4. So, the next action is (0, 4).

5. Move the next block (White) from stack 0 to stack 4, which already has a White block. The cost of this move is 4. So, the next action is (0, 4).

6. Move the next block (Black) from stack 0 to stack 2, which already has a Black block. The cost of this move is 2. So, the next action is (0, 2).

7. Move the last block (Pink) from stack 0 to stack 1, which already has a Pink block. The cost of this move is 7. So, the next action is (0, 1).

8. Repeat the process for the remaining stacks. For each stack, move the top block to the stack that has only blocks of that shade if such a stack exists, otherwise move it to the next empty stack. Always choose the stack with the least cost to move the block to.
