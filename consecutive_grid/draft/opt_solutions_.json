The sums of columns must be None, 230, 255, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 267, 217, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 235. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['62' 'x' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' '69' '76']\n ['x' 'x' '48' '54']\n ['x' 'x' '61' '75']]",

Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' '63' '59' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' '57' 'x']\n ['60' 'x' 'x' '70']\n ['71' 'x' '54' 'x']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 227, 183, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 195, 195, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 208. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' 'x' 'x' '55']\n ['x' 'x' '52' '49']\n ['x' '61' 'x' '45']\n ['x' '56' 'x' 'x']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 218, 213, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 223, 205, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 231. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' '51' 'x' '67']\n ['x' '71' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' '44']\n ['x' '43' '58' 'x']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 206, 127, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 204, 151, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 181. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['43' 'x' 'x' 'x']\n ['60' '59' 'x' '53']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' '38']\n ['x' '54' 'x' '42']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 222, 201, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 210, 211, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 205. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' '42' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' '66' '43' '46']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' '61']\n ['x' '50' 'x' 'x']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 138, 202, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 197, 165, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 152. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unknown number at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['27' '44' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']\n ['45' '29' 'x' '43']\n ['x' '24' '23' 'x']]",

The sums of columns must be None, 250, 214, None for columns 0 to 3 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 217, 213, None for rows 0 to 3 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid should equal 232. The goal is to find unique integers in the given range to replace with \u2018x\u2019s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible.
