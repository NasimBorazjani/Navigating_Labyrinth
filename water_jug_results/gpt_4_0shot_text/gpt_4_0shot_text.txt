The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following ones. We start by filling the third bucket, then the second, and finally the first. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 136-liter jug twice ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 136, 3), then fill it with the 75-liter jug once ('+', 75, 3) to reach a total of 347 liters.
2. Remove 4 liters from the third bucket with the 40-liter jug ('-', 40, 3), then fill the jug again and pour it into the second bucket ('+', 40, 2).
3. Fill the second bucket with the 136-liter jug twice ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 136, 2), then fill it with the 75-liter jug once ('+', 75, 2) to reach a total of 387 liters.
4. Remove 90 liters from the second bucket with the 40-liter jug twice ('-', 40, 2), ('-', 40, 2), and the 44-liter jug once ('-', 44, 2), then fill the 44-liter jug again and pour it into the first bucket ('+', 44, 1).
5. Fill the first bucket with the 136-liter jug twice ('+', 136, 1), ('+', 136, 1), then fill it with the 75-liter jug once ('+', 75, 1) to reach a total of 391 liters.
6. Remove 117 liters from the first bucket with the 40-liter jug twice ('-', 40, 1), ('-', 40, 1), the 44-liter jug twice ('-', 44, 1), ('-', 44, 1), and the 41-liter jug once ('-', 41, 1).

The problem can be solved by filling the buckets in the order of their capacities, starting with the largest one. We can use the jugs with the exact capacities needed to fill the buckets. Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill the third bucket with 243 liters of water using the jug with capacity 243. This is represented as ('+', 243, 3).
2. Fill the second bucket with 237 liters of water using the jug with capacity 237. This is represented as ('+', 237, 2).
3. Fill the first bucket with 225 liters of water using the jug with capacity 225. This is represented as ('+', 225, 1).

However, we don't have jugs with capacities 243, 237, and 225. We have to use the jugs we have to fill the buckets. Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill the third bucket with 132 liters of water using the jug with capacity 132. This is represented as ('+', 132, 3).
2. Fill the third bucket with 111 liters of water using the jug with capacity 111. This is represented as ('+', 111, 3).
3. Fill the second bucket with 132 liters of water using the jug with capacity 132. This is represented as ('+', 132, 2).
4. Fill the second bucket with 88 liters of water using the jug with capacity 88. This is represented as ('+', 88, 2).
5. Fill the second bucket with 17 liters of water using the jug with capacity 17. This is represented as ('+', 17, 2).
6. Fill the first bucket with 111 liters of water using the jug with capacity 111. This is represented as ('+', 111, 1).

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then proceeds to the next largest bucket and jug, and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket without violating the condition that a bucket cannot contain more water than the next bucket in line, the algorithm skips to the next largest jug. The algorithm continues until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the 3rd bucket with the 111-liter jug once and the 92-liter jug twice. The actions are ('+', 111, 3), ('+', 92, 3), ('+', 92, 3).
2. Fill the 2nd bucket with the 92-liter jug twice and the 48-liter jug once. The actions are ('+', 92, 2), ('+', 92, 2), ('+', 48, 2).
3. Fill the 1st bucket with the 48-liter jug three times and the 22-liter jug once. The actions are ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 22, 1).

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The idea is to always fill the largest bucket that can be filled without violating the constraints. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 128-liter jug twice and the 57-liter jug once. This gives us 313 liters in the third bucket. The actions are ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 57, 3).

2. Fill the second bucket with the 128-liter jug twice and the 105-liter jug once. This gives us 361 liters in the second bucket. The actions are ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 105, 2).

3. Fill the first bucket with the 128-liter jug twice and the 57-liter jug once. This gives us 313 liters in the first bucket. The actions are ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 57, 1).

4. Fill the third bucket with the 78-liter jug once. This gives us 386 liters in the third bucket. The action is ('+', 78, 3).

5. Fill the second bucket with the 15-liter jug once. This gives us 376 liters in the second bucket. The action is ('+', 15, 2).

6. Fill the first bucket with the 31-liter jug once. This gives us 344 liters in the first bucket. The action is ('+', 31, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 128, 3), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 57, 3), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 105, 2), ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 57, 1), ('+', 78, 3), ('+', 15, 2), ('+', 31, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the third bucket, then the second, and finally the first. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 140-liter jug twice, then with the 130-liter jug once, and finally with the 58-liter jug once. This gives us 431 liters in the third bucket.
2. Fill the second bucket with the 140-liter jug twice, then with the 125-liter jug once, and finally with the 58-liter jug once. This gives us 401 liters in the second bucket.
3. Fill the first bucket with the 140-liter jug twice, then with the 129-liter jug once, and finally with the 58-liter jug once. This gives us 391 liters in the first bucket.

The sequence of actions is therefore:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. 

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 99-liter jug. So, the first action is ('+', 99, 1).
2. The first bucket still needs 148 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 78-liter jug. So, the second action is ('+', 78, 1).
3. The first bucket still needs 70 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 46-liter jug. So, the third action is ('+', 46, 1).
4. The first bucket still needs 24 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 24-liter jug. So, the fourth action is ('+', 24, 1).
5. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 145-liter jug. So, the fifth action is ('+', 145, 2).
6. The second bucket still needs 195 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 99-liter jug. So, the sixth action is ('+', 99, 2).
7. The second bucket still needs 96 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 78-liter jug. So, the seventh action is ('+', 78, 2).
8. The second bucket still needs 18 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 18-liter jug. So, the eighth action is ('+', 18, 2).
9. Move to the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 145-liter jug. So, the ninth action is ('+', 145, 3).
10. The third bucket still needs 223 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 99-liter jug. So, the tenth action is ('+', 99, 3).
11. The third bucket still needs 124 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 78-liter jug. So, the eleventh action is ('+', 78, 3).
12. The third bucket still needs 46 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 46-liter jug. So, the twelfth action is ('+', 46, 3).

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 85-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug to get 170 liters. Then, use the 76-liter jug to add 76 liters, and finally the 47-liter jug to add 47 liters. The third bucket now contains 293 liters. The remaining 41 liters can be added using the 47-liter jug. The actions are: ('+', 85, 3), ('+', 85, 3), ('+', 76, 3), ('+', 47, 3), ('+', 47, 3).

2. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third bucket is the 85-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug to get 170 liters. Then, use the 47-liter jug to add 47 liters. The second bucket now contains 217 liters. The actions are: ('+', 85, 2), ('+', 85, 2), ('+', 47, 2).

3. Finally, fill the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the second or third bucket is the 85-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug to get 170 liters. Then, use the 33-liter jug to add 33 liters. The first bucket now contains 203 liters. The actions are: ('+', 85, 1), ('+', 85, 1), ('+', 33, 1).

The final sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then proceeds to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, the algorithm moves to the next smaller jug. The algorithm continues until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill bucket 3 with jug 144 (236 liters remaining in bucket 3).
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 144 again (92 liters remaining in bucket 3).
3. Fill bucket 3 with jug 79 (13 liters remaining in bucket 3).
4. Fill bucket 3 with jug 37 (completes bucket 3).
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 144 (189 liters remaining in bucket 2).
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 144 again (45 liters remaining in bucket 2).
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 37 (8 liters remaining in bucket 2).

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. 

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 102-liter jug. So, the first action is ('+', 102, 1).
2. The first bucket still needs 163 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 82-liter jug. So, the second action is ('+', 82, 1).
3. The first bucket still needs 81 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 82-liter jug. So, the third action is ('+', 82, 1).
4. Now, the first bucket is overfilled by 1 liter. So, the fourth action is ('-', 1, 1).
5. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third bucket is the 130-liter jug. So, the fifth action is ('+', 130, 2).
6. The second bucket still needs 238 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third bucket is the 116-liter jug. So, the sixth action is ('+', 116, 2).
7. The second bucket still needs 122 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third bucket is the 116-liter jug. So, the seventh action is ('+', 116, 2).
8. Now, the second bucket is overfilled by 10 liters. So, the eighth action is ('-', 10, 2).
9. Move to the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the 133-liter jug. So, the ninth action is ('+', 133, 3).
10. The third bucket still needs 245 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used is the 131-liter jug. So, the tenth action is ('+', 131, 3).
11. The third bucket still needs 114 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used is the 116-liter jug. So, the eleventh action is ('+', 116, 3).
12. Now, the third bucket is overfilled by 2 liters. So, the twelfth action is ('-', 2, 3).

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 102, 1), ('+', 82, 1), ('+', 82, 1), ('-', 1, 1), ('+', 130, 2), ('+', 116, 2), ('+', 116, 2), ('-', 10, 2), ('+', 133, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 116, 3), ('-', 2, 3)]

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The idea is to always fill the largest bucket that can be filled without violating the constraints. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 143-liter jug and the 87-liter jug. This gives us a total of 230 liters in the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 143, 3) and ('+', 87, 3).

2. Fill the second bucket with the 143-liter jug and the 87-liter jug. This gives us a total of 230 liters in the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 143, 2) and ('+', 87, 2).

3. Fill the first bucket with the 143-liter jug and the 87-liter jug. This gives us a total of 230 liters in the first bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 143, 1) and ('+', 87, 1).

4. Fill the third bucket with the 116-liter jug and the 84-liter jug. This gives us a total of 430 liters in the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 116, 3) and ('+', 84, 3).

5. Fill the second bucket with the 116-liter jug and the 84-liter jug. This gives us a total of 430 liters in the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 116, 2) and ('+', 84, 2).

6. Fill the third bucket with the 10-liter jug. This gives us a total of 440 liters in the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 10, 3).

7. Fill the second bucket with the 10-liter jug. This gives us a total of 440 liters in the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 10, 2).

8. Fill the first bucket with the 116-liter jug and the 52-liter jug. This gives us a total of 398 liters in the first bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 116, 1) and ('+', 52, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and so on. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 143-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice ('+', 143, 3), ('+', 143, 3). The third bucket now contains 286 liters, which is less than the required 353 liters.

2. The next largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 61-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once ('+', 61, 3). The third bucket now contains 347 liters.

3. The next largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 6-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once ('+', 6, 3). The third bucket now contains 353 liters, which is the required amount.

4. Move on to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 140-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 140, 2). The second bucket now contains 280 liters, which is the required amount.

5. Move on to the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 98-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice ('+', 98, 1), ('+', 98, 1). The first bucket now contains 196 liters, which is less than the required 280 liters.

6. The next largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 62-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once ('+', 62, 1). The first bucket now contains 258 liters.

7. The next largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 21-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once ('+', 21, 1). The first bucket now contains 279 liters.

8. The next largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 1-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once ('+', 1, 1). The first bucket now contains 280 liters, which is the required amount.

The sequence of actions is therefore:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or make it contain more water than the next bucket. We start by filling the third bucket, then the second, and finally the first. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 124-liter jug twice, then with the 98-liter jug once, and finally with the 40-liter jug once. This gives us 386 liters, which is more than the required 360 liters. So, we need to remove 26 liters from the third bucket. We can do this by using the 72-liter jug to remove water twice, then the 45-liter jug once, and finally the 16-liter jug once. This leaves us with 360 liters in the third bucket.

2. Next, we fill the second bucket with the 124-liter jug twice, then with the 98-liter jug once. This gives us 346 liters, which is more than the required 341 liters. So, we need to remove 5 liters from the second bucket. We can do this by using the 16-liter jug to remove water once, then the 45-liter jug once, and finally the 57-liter jug once. This leaves us with 341 liters in the second bucket.

3. Finally, we fill the first bucket with the 124-liter jug twice, then with the 99-liter jug once, and finally with the 40-liter jug once. This gives us 387 liters, which is more than the required 263 liters. So, we need to remove 124 liters from the first bucket. We can do this by using the 72-liter jug to remove water once, then the 45-liter jug once, and finally the 16-liter jug once. This leaves us with 263 liters in the first bucket.

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and finally the first. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 145-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 145, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 296 - 145 = 151 liters.

2. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 107-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 107, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 151 - 107 = 44 liters.

3. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 31-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 31, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 44 - 31 = 13 liters.

4. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 14-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 15-liter jug, fill it to the top, and then remove 2 liters. The actions are ('+', 15, 3) and ('-', 2, 3). The third bucket is now full.

5. Move on to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 118-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 118, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 258 - 118 = 140 liters.

6. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 88-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 88, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 140 - 88 = 52 liters.

7. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 31-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 31, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 52 - 31 = 21 liters.

8. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 15-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 15, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 21 - 15 = 6 liters.

9. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 14-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 14-liter jug, fill it to the top, and then remove 8 liters. The actions are ('+', 14, 2) and ('-', 8, 2). The second bucket is now full.

10. Finally, fill the first bucket with the 226-liter jug. The action is ('+', 226, 1).

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 145, 3), ('+', 107, 3), ('+', 31, 3), ('+', 15, 3), ('-', 2, 3), ('+', 118, 2), ('+', 88, 2), ('+', 31, 2), ('+', 15, 2), ('+', 14, 2), ('-', 8, 2), ('+', 226, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and so on, until all buckets are filled. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 131-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, which gives us 262 liters. We still need 193 liters, so we use the 106-liter jug next, which gives us 368 liters. We still need 87 liters, so we use the 88-liter jug next, which overfills the bucket by 1 liter. We then remove 1 liter using the 13-liter jug, which gives us the desired 455 liters. The actions are: ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 106, 3), ('+', 88, 3), ('-', 13, 3).

2. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 131-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, which gives us 262 liters. We still need 132 liters, so we use the 107-liter jug next, which gives us 369 liters. We still need 25 liters, so we use the 20-liter jug next, which gives us 389 liters. We still need 5 liters, so we use the 13-liter jug next, which overfills the bucket by 8 liters. We then remove 8 liters using the 13-liter jug, which gives us the desired 394 liters. The actions are: ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 107, 2), ('+', 20, 2), ('+', 13, 2), ('-', 13, 2).

3. Finally, fill the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 131-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, which gives us 262 liters. We still need 25 liters, so we use the 20-liter jug next, which gives us 282 liters. We still need 5 liters, so we use the 13-liter jug next, which overfills the bucket by 8 liters.

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following ones. We start with the first bucket and move on to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, the first action is ('+', 149, 1).

2. The first bucket now contains 149 liters of water, and we need 149 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, the second action is ('+', 149, 1).

3. The first bucket is now full, so we move on to the second one. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third one is the one with capacity 132 liters. So, the third action is ('+', 132, 2).

4. The second bucket now contains 132 liters of water, and we need 298 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third one is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, the fourth action is ('+', 149, 2).

5. The second bucket now contains 281 liters of water, and we need 149 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third one is the one with capacity 149 liters. However, this would overfill the bucket, so we have to use the next largest jug, which has a capacity of 120 liters. So, the fifth action is ('+', 120, 2).

6. The second bucket now contains 401 liters of water, and we need 29 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third one is the one with capacity 42 liters. However, this would overfill the bucket, so we have to use the next largest jug, which has a capacity of 24 liters. So, the sixth action is ('+', 24, 2).

7. The second bucket now contains 425 liters of water, and we need 5 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the third one is the one with capacity 5 liters. So, the seventh action is ('+', 5, 2).

8. The second bucket is now full, so we move on to the third one. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, the eighth action is ('+', 149, 3).

9. The third bucket now contains 149 liters of water, and we need 319 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, the ninth action is ('+', 149, 3).

10. The third bucket now contains 298 liters of water, and we need 170 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 149 liters. However, this would not fill the bucket, so we have to use the next largest jug, which has a capacity of 120 liters. So, the tenth action is ('+', 120, 3).

11. The third bucket now contains 418 liters of water, and we need 50 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 62 liters. However, this would overfill the bucket, so we have to use the next largest jug, which has a capacity of 42 liters. So, the eleventh action is ('+', 42, 3).

12. The third bucket now contains 460 liters of water, and we need 8 more to fill it. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 8 liters. So, the twelfth action is ('+', 8, 3).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 150 liters. So, the first action is ('+', 150, 1).

2. The first bucket now contains 150 liters of water. It needs 93 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the next one is the one with capacity 84 liters. So, the second action is ('+', 84, 1).

3. The first bucket now contains 234 liters of water. It needs 9 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the next one is the one with capacity 9 liters. So, the third action is ('+', 9, 1).

4. The first bucket is now full. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the next one is the one with capacity 140 liters. So, the fourth action is ('+', 140, 2).

5. The second bucket now contains 140 liters of water. It needs 110 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the next one is the one with capacity 98 liters. So, the fifth action is ('+', 98, 2).

6. The second bucket now contains 238 liters of water. It needs 12 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or the next one is the one with capacity 12 liters. So, the sixth action is ('+', 12, 2).

7. The second bucket is now full. Move to the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 150 liters. So, the seventh action is ('+', 150, 3).

8. The third bucket now contains 150 liters of water. It needs 296 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 140 liters. So, the eighth action is ('+', 140, 3).

9. The third bucket now contains 290 liters of water. It needs 156 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 98 liters. So, the ninth action is ('+', 98, 3).

10. The third bucket now contains 388 liters of water. It needs 58 more liters to be full. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 58 liters. So, the tenth action is ('+', 58, 3).

The sequence of actions is therefore: 

[('+', 150, 1), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 9, 1), ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 98, 2), ('+', 12, 2), ('+', 150, 3), ('+', 140, 3), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 58, 3)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not violate the constraints to fill the buckets. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the largest bucket (number 3). The largest jug that can be used to fill it without overfilling is the 148-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, then use the 75-liter jug to fill the remaining 152 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 148, 3), ('+', 148, 3), ('+', 75, 3).

2. Next, fill the second bucket (number 2). The largest jug that can be used to fill it without overfilling is the 111-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, then use the 58-liter jug to fill the remaining 58 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 111, 2), ('+', 111, 2), ('+', 58, 2).

3. Finally, fill the first bucket (number 1). The largest jug that can be used to fill it without overfilling is the 84-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug three times, then use the 1-liter jug to fill the remaining 1 liter. This gives us the actions ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 1, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 148, 3), ('+', 148, 3), ('+', 75, 3), ('+', 111, 2), ('+', 111, 2), ('+', 58, 2), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 84, 1), ('+', 1, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or violate the condition that the amount of water in each bucket cannot exceed the amount of water in the bucket placed after it. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 137 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, and then use the jug with capacity 29 liters. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 29, 1).

2. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or violating the condition is the one with capacity 138 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug twice, and then use the jug with capacity 64 liters. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 138, 2), ('+', 138, 2), ('+', 64, 2).

3. Finally, fill the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or violating the condition is the one with capacity 138 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug three times, and then use the jug with capacity 70 liters, 47 liters, 64 liters and 16 liters. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 70, 3), ('+', 47, 3), ('+', 64, 3), ('+', 16, 3).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and so on, until all buckets are filled. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order. The sorted jugs are [146, 145, 132, 80, 69, 57, 52].

2. Start with the last bucket (bucket 3). The target amount of water is 549 liters. 

3. Choose the largest jug that does not overfill the bucket. The largest jug that can be used is 146 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 146, 3). The remaining amount of water needed is 549 - 146 = 403 liters.

4. Repeat step 3 until the bucket is filled. The actions are ('+', 146, 3), ('+', 132, 3), ('+', 80, 3), ('+', 69, 3), ('+', 26, 3).

5. Move to the next bucket (bucket 2). The target amount of water is 538 liters. 

6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for this bucket. The actions are ('+', 146, 2), ('+', 132, 2), ('+', 132, 2), ('+', 80, 2), ('+', 48, 2).

7. Move to the first bucket (bucket 1). The target amount of water is 456 liters.

8. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for this bucket. The actions are ('+', 146, 1), ('+', 132, 1), ('+', 132, 1), ('+', 46, 1).

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 146 liters. So, the first action is ('+', 146, 3). This leaves us with 509 - 146 = 363 liters to fill in the third bucket.

2. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 146 liters again. So, the second action is ('+', 146, 3). This leaves us with 363 - 146 = 217 liters to fill in the third bucket.

3. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 109 liters. So, the third action is ('+', 109, 3). This leaves us with 217 - 109 = 108 liters to fill in the third bucket.

4. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 68 liters. So, the fourth action is ('+', 68, 3). This leaves us with 108 - 68 = 40 liters to fill in the third bucket.

5. The only jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 17 liters. So, the fifth action is ('+', 17, 3). This leaves us with 40 - 17 = 23 liters to fill in the third bucket.

6. The only jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 17 liters again. So, the sixth action is ('+', 17, 3). This leaves us with 23 - 17 = 6 liters to fill in the third bucket.

7. The only jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 17 liters again. So, the seventh action is ('+', 17, 3). This leaves us with 6 - 17 = -11 liters to fill in the third bucket, which is not possible.

8. So, we need to remove the last added water. The eighth action is ('-', 17, 3). This leaves us with 6 liters to fill in the third bucket.

9. Now, we move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 146 liters. So, the ninth action is ('+', 146, 2). This leaves us with 466 - 146 = 320 liters to fill in the second bucket.

10. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 146 liters again. So, the tenth action is ('+', 146, 2). This leaves us with 320 - 146 = 174 liters to fill in the second bucket.

11. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 109 liters. So, the eleventh action is ('+', 109, 2). This leaves us with 174 - 109 = 65 liters to fill in the second bucket.

12. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 68 liters. So, the twelfth action is ('+', 68, 2). This leaves us with 65 - 68 = -3 liters to fill in the second bucket, which is not possible.

13. So, we need to remove the last added water. The thirteenth action is ('-', 68, 2). This leaves us with 65 liters to fill in the second bucket.

14. Now, we move to the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 146 liters. So, the fourteenth action is ('+', 146, 1). This leaves us with 448 - 146 = 302 liters to fill in the first bucket.

15. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 146 liters again. So, the fifteenth action is ('+', 146, 1). This leaves us with 302 - 146 = 156 liters to fill in the first bucket.

16. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 109 liters. So, the sixteenth action is ('+', 109, 1). This leaves us with 156 - 109 = 47 liters to fill in the first bucket.

17. The largest jug that can be used now is the one with capacity 68 liters. So, the seventeenth action is ('+', 68, 1). This leaves us with 47 - 68 = -21 liters to fill in the first bucket, which is not possible.

18. So, we need to remove the last added water. The eighteenth action is ('-', 68, 1). This leaves us with 47 liters to fill in the first bucket.

The final sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move on to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 1 with jug 120. ('+', 120, 1)
2. Fill bucket 1 with jug 95. ('+', 95, 1)
3. Fill bucket 1 with jug 10. ('+', 10, 1)
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 2)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 120. ('+', 120, 2)
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 44. ('+', 44, 2)
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 20. ('+', 20, 2)
8. Fill bucket 3 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 3)
9. Fill bucket 3 with jug 120. ('+', 120, 3)
10. Fill bucket 3 with jug 95. ('+', 95, 3)
11. Fill bucket 3 with jug 16. ('+', 16, 3)

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and so on, until all buckets are filled. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once, then fill it with the 94-liter jug, and finally with the 30-liter jug. The third bucket now contains 262 liters of water. The remaining 24 liters can be filled with the 24-liter jug. The actions are ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 94, 3), ('+', 30, 3), ('+', 24, 3).

2. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once, then fill it with the 94-liter jug, and finally with the 30-liter jug. The second bucket now contains 262 liters of water. The remaining 13 liters can be filled with the 11-liter jug and the 2-liter jug. The actions are ('+', 138, 2), ('+', 94, 2), ('+', 30, 2), ('+', 11, 2), ('+', 2, 2).

3. Finally, fill the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once, then fill it with the 94-liter jug, and finally with the 7-liter jug. The first bucket now contains 239 liters of water. The actions are ('+', 138, 1), ('+', 94, 1), ('+', 7, 1).

The final sequence of actions is:

[('+', 138, 3), ('+', 94, 3), ('+', 30, 3), ('+', 24, 3), ('+', 138, 2), ('+', 94, 2), ('+', 30, 2), ('+', 11, 2), ('+', 2, 2), ('+', 138, 1), ('+', 94, 1), ('+', 7, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. 

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the first action is ('+', 128, 1).
2. The remaining capacity in the first bucket is 394 - 128 = 266 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the second action is ('+', 128, 1).
3. The remaining capacity in the first bucket is 266 - 128 = 138 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the third action is ('+', 128, 1).
4. The remaining capacity in the first bucket is 138 - 128 = 10 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 10 liters. So the fourth action is ('+', 10, 1).
5. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the fifth action is ('+', 128, 2).
6. The remaining capacity in the second bucket is 425 - 128 = 297 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the sixth action is ('+', 128, 2).
7. The remaining capacity in the second bucket is 297 - 128 = 169 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the seventh action is ('+', 128, 2).
8. The remaining capacity in the second bucket is 169 - 128 = 41 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 41 liters. So the eighth action is ('+', 41, 2).
9. Move to the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the ninth action is ('+', 128, 3).
10. The remaining capacity in the third bucket is 426 - 128 = 298 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the tenth action is ('+', 128, 3).
11. The remaining capacity in the third bucket is 298 - 128 = 170 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 128 liters. So the eleventh action is ('+', 128, 3).
12. The remaining capacity in the third bucket is 170 - 128 = 42 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is 42 liters. So the twelfth action is ('+', 42, 3).

So the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then move on to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, we move on to the next largest jug. If a bucket is filled, we move on to the next bucket. If a jug is emptied, we move on to the next largest jug. We continue this process until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill bucket 3 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 3)
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 3)
3. Fill bucket 3 with jug 108: ('+', 108, 3)
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 2)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 2)

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 80 liters. So, we add 80 liters to the first bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 80, 1).

2. The first bucket still needs 90 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 82 liters. So, we add 82 liters to the first bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 82, 1).

3. The first bucket still needs 8 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 12 liters. So, we add 12 liters to the first bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 12, 1).

4. Now, the first bucket is full and we move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 107 liters. So, we add 107 liters to the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 107, 2).

5. The second bucket still needs 278 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 108 liters. So, we add 108 liters to the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 108, 2).

6. The second bucket still needs 170 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 95 liters. So, we add 95 liters to the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 95, 2).

7. The second bucket still needs 75 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 80 liters. So, we add 80 liters to the second bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 80, 2).

8. Now, the second bucket is overfilled by 5 liters. We need to remove 5 liters from the second bucket. The smallest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 12 liters. So, we remove 5 liters from the second bucket. The action is represented as ('-', 12, 2).

9. Now, the second bucket is full and we move to the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 108 liters. So, we add 108 liters to the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 108, 3).

10. The third bucket still needs 391 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 107 liters. So, we add 107 liters to the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 107, 3).

11. The third bucket still needs 284 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 108 liters. So, we add 108 liters to the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 108, 3).

12. The third bucket still needs 176 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 95 liters. So, we add 95 liters to the third bucket. The action is represented as ('+', 95, 3).

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move to the previous ones. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 149 liters. So, we add 149 liters to the third bucket. The action is ('+', 149, 3).

2. The remaining amount of water needed for the third bucket is 233 - 149 = 84 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 80 liters. So, we add 80 liters to the third bucket. The action is ('+', 80, 3).

3. The remaining amount of water needed for the third bucket is 84 - 80 = 4 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 4 liters. So, we add 4 liters to the third bucket. The action is ('+', 4, 3).

4. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 149 liters. But it would overfill the bucket. So, we use the next largest jug, which is the one with capacity 80 liters. We add 80 liters to the second bucket. The action is ('+', 80, 2).

5. The remaining amount of water needed for the second bucket is 202 - 80 = 122 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 72 liters. So, we add 72 liters to the second bucket. The action is ('+', 72, 2).

6. The remaining amount of water needed for the second bucket is 122 - 72 = 50 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 45 liters. So, we add 45 liters to the second bucket. The action is ('+', 45, 2).

7. The remaining amount of water needed for the second bucket is 50 - 45 = 5 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 5 liters. So, we add 5 liters to the second bucket. The action is ('+', 5, 2).

8. Move to the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 149 liters. But it would overfill the bucket. So, we use the next largest jug, which is the one with capacity 80 liters. We add 80 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 80, 1).

9. The remaining amount of water needed for the first bucket is 201 - 80 = 121 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 72 liters. So, we add 72 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 72, 1).

10. The remaining amount of water needed for the first bucket is 121 - 72 = 49 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 45 liters. So, we add 45 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 45, 1).

11. The remaining amount of water needed for the first bucket is 49 - 45 = 4 liters. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 4 liters. So, we add 4 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 4, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the buckets from left to right, and when we can't add more water to a bucket without violating the constraints, we move on to the next one. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 1 with jug 137 ('+', 137, 1)
2. Fill bucket 1 with jug 104 ('+', 104, 1)
3. Fill bucket 1 with jug 83 ('+', 83, 1)
4. Fill bucket 1 with jug 19 ('+', 19, 1)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 137 ('+', 137, 2)
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 128 ('+', 128, 2)
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 104 ('+', 104, 2)
8. Fill bucket 2 with jug 4 ('+', 4, 2)
9. Fill bucket 3 with jug 137 ('+', 137, 3)
10. Fill bucket 3 with jug 128 ('+', 128, 3)
11. Fill bucket 3 with jug 104 ('+', 104, 3)
12. Fill bucket 3 with jug 83 ('+', 83, 3)
13. Fill bucket 3 with jug 46 ('+', 46, 3)
14. Fill bucket 3 with jug 34 ('+', 34, 3)
15. Fill bucket 3 with jug 19 ('+', 19, 3)

So the solution is:

[('+', 137, 1), ('+', 104, 1), ('+', 83, 1), ('+', 19, 1), ('+', 137, 2), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 104, 2), ('+', 4, 2), ('+', 137, 3), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 104, 3), ('+', 83, 3), ('+', 46, 3), ('+', 34, 3), ('+', 19, 3)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then move on to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, we move on to the next largest jug. If a bucket is filled, we move on to the next bucket. If a jug is emptied, we move on to the next largest jug. We continue this process until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill bucket 3 with jug 148. The state is now (0, 0, 148).
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 148 again. The state is now (0, 0, 296).
3. Fill bucket 3 with jug 143. The state is now (0, 0, 439).
4. Fill bucket 3 with jug 40. The state is now (0, 0, 479).
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 148. The state is now (0, 148, 479).
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 67. The state is now (0, 215, 479).
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 17. The state is now (0, 232, 479).
8. Fill bucket 2 with jug 15. The state is now (0, 247, 479).
9. Fill bucket 1 with jug 114. The state is now (114, 247, 479).
10. Fill bucket 1 with jug 67. The state is now (181, 247, 479).
11. Fill bucket 1 with jug 11. The state is now (192, 247, 479).

So the shortest sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or make it contain more water than the next bucket. We start by filling the third bucket, then the second, and finally the first. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill the third bucket with the 141-liter jug once and the 120-liter jug once. This gives us 261 liters, which is too much, so we empty the bucket with the 26-liter jug once to get 235 liters. Then we fill it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 261 liters again, and finally we empty it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 235 liters. This gives us the action sequence ('+', 141, 3), ('+', 120, 3), ('-', 26, 3), ('+', 26, 3), ('-', 26, 3).

2. Fill the second bucket with the 141-liter jug once and the 110-liter jug once. This gives us 251 liters, which is too much, so we empty the bucket with the 26-liter jug once to get 225 liters. Then we fill it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 251 liters again, and finally we empty it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 225 liters. This gives us the action sequence ('+', 141, 2), ('+', 110, 2), ('-', 26, 2), ('+', 26, 2), ('-', 26, 2).

3. Fill the first bucket with the 141-liter jug once and the 110-liter jug once. This gives us 251 liters, which is too much, so we empty the bucket with the 26-liter jug once to get 225 liters. Then we fill it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 251 liters again, and finally we empty it with the 26-liter jug once more to get 225 liters. This gives us the action sequence ('+', 141, 1), ('+', 110, 1), ('-', 26, 1), ('+', 26, 1), ('-', 26, 1).

The final sequence of actions is therefore:

[('+', 141, 3), ('+', 120, 3), ('-', 26, 3), ('+', 26, 3), ('-', 26, 3), ('+', 141, 2), ('+', 110, 2), ('-', 26, 2), ('+', 26, 2), ('-', 26, 2), ('+', 141, 1), ('+', 110, 1), ('-', 26, 1), ('+', 26, 1), ('-', 26, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket first, then the second largest, and finally the smallest. We always use the largest jug that does not cause the bucket to overflow. If a jug is too large, we move on to the next largest jug. If a jug is too small, we use it and then move on to the next largest jug. If a jug is just right, we use it and then move on to the next bucket. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 3 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 3)
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 3)
3. Fill bucket 3 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 3)
4. Fill bucket 3 with jug 80. ('+', 80, 3)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 2)
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 150. ('+', 150, 2)
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 146. ('+', 146, 2)
8. Fill bucket 1 with jug 121. ('+', 121, 1)
9. Fill bucket 1 with jug 121. ('+', 121, 1)
10. Fill bucket 1 with jug 7. ('+', 7, 1)

So the solution is:

[('+', 150, 3), ('+', 150, 3), ('+', 150, 3), ('+', 80, 3), ('+', 150, 2), ('+', 150, 2), ('+', 146, 2), ('+', 121, 1), ('+', 121, 1), ('+', 7, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start by filling the last bucket, then the second last, and finally the first. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 140-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 140, 3), ('+', 140, 3). The remaining amount to fill in the third bucket is 578 - 2*140 = 298 liters.

2. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in the third bucket is the 116-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 116, 3), ('+', 116, 3). The remaining amount to fill in the third bucket is 298 - 2*116 = 66 liters.

3. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in the third bucket is the 66-liter jug. Fill the bucket once with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 66, 3). The third bucket is now full.

4. Move to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 140-liter jug. Fill the bucket three times with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 140, 2). The remaining amount to fill in the second bucket is 488 - 3*140 = 68 liters.

5. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in the second bucket is the 68-liter jug. Fill the bucket once with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 68, 2). The second bucket is now full.

6. Move to the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 140-liter jug. Fill the bucket once with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 140, 1). The remaining amount to fill in the first bucket is 279 - 140 = 139 liters.

7. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in the first bucket is the 139-liter jug. Fill the bucket once with this jug. The sequence of actions is: ('+', 139, 1). The first bucket is now full.

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 140, 3), ('+', 140, 3), ('+', 116, 3), ('+', 116, 3), ('+', 66, 3), ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 140, 2), ('+', 68, 2), ('+', 140, 1), ('+', 139, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not violate the constraints to fill the buckets. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order of their capacities.
2. Start filling the buckets from the largest to the smallest. For each bucket, choose the largest jug that does not make the total amount of water in the bucket exceed its capacity and does not violate the constraint that the amount of water in each bucket cannot at any point in time exceed the amount of water in the bucket placed after it.
3. Repeat step 2 until all buckets are filled to their capacities.

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 3 with jug 141: ('+', 141, 3)
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 114: ('+', 114, 3)
3. Fill bucket 3 with jug 133: ('+', 133, 3)
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 141: ('+', 141, 2)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 133: ('+', 133, 2)
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 78: ('+', 78, 2)
7. Fill bucket 1 with jug 141: ('+', 141, 1)
8. Fill bucket 1 with jug 114: ('+', 114, 1)

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the third bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 133-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 133, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 307 - 133 = 174 liters.

2. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 66-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 66, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 174 - 66 = 108 liters.

3. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 94-liter jug. However, using this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we use the next largest jug, which is the 86-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 86, 3). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 108 - 86 = 22 liters.

4. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the third bucket is the 22-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 22, 3). The third bucket is now full.

5. Move on to the second bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 134-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 134, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 303 - 134 = 169 liters.

6. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 124-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 124, 2). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 169 - 124 = 45 liters.

7. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the second bucket is the 45-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 45, 2). The second bucket is now full.

8. Move on to the first bucket. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 107-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 107, 1). The remaining capacity in the bucket is 229 - 107 = 122 liters.

9. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining capacity in the first bucket is the 122-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 122, 1). The first bucket is now full.

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket. We start with the largest bucket and work our way down to the smallest. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 4 with jug 87 three times and jug 61 once. This gives us 317 liters in bucket 4. The actions are ('+', 87, 4), ('+', 87, 4), ('+', 87, 4), ('+', 61, 4).
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 87 two times and jug 61 once, then jug 48 twice and jug 33 once. This gives us 238 liters in bucket 3. The actions are ('+', 87, 3), ('+', 87, 3), ('+', 61, 3), ('+', 48, 3), ('+', 48, 3), ('+', 33, 3).
3. Fill bucket 2 with jug 87 two times and jug 48 once, then jug 33 once. This gives us 225 liters in bucket 2. The actions are ('+', 87, 2), ('+', 87, 2), ('+', 48, 2), ('+', 33, 2).
4. Fill bucket 1 with jug 87 once, then jug 48 once, then jug 33 once. This gives us 170 liters in bucket 1. The actions are ('+', 87, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 33, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 87, 4), ('+', 87, 4), ('+', 87, 4), ('+', 61, 4), ('+', 87, 3), ('+', 87, 3), ('+', 61, 3), ('+', 48, 3), ('+', 48, 3), ('+', 33, 3), ('+', 87, 2), ('+', 87, 2), ('+', 48, 2), ('+', 33, 2), ('+', 87, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 33, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. If a jug is too large for the current bucket, we move to the next one. If a jug is too large for all remaining buckets, we discard it and choose the next largest one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket (260 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 148 liters. So, we add 148 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 148, 1).

2. The first bucket still needs 112 liters. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 88 liters. So, we add 88 liters to the first bucket. The action is ('+', 88, 1).

3. The first bucket still needs 24 liters. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 12 liters. So, we add 12 liters to the first bucket twice. The actions are ('+', 12, 1) and ('+', 12, 1).

4. Move to the second bucket (295 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 143 liters. So, we add 143 liters to the second bucket twice. The actions are ('+', 143, 2) and ('+', 143, 2).

5. The second bucket still needs 9 liters. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 12 liters. So, we add 12 liters to the second bucket and then remove 3 liters. The actions are ('+', 12, 2) and ('-', 3, 2).

6. Move to the third bucket (331 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 131 liters. So, we add 131 liters to the third bucket twice and then add 69 liters. The actions are ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), and ('+', 69, 3).

7. Move to the fourth bucket (394 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is the one with 143 liters. So, we add 143 liters to the fourth bucket twice and then add 108 liters. The actions are ('+', 143, 4), ('+', 143, 4), and ('+', 108, 4).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by filling the buckets in ascending order, using the largest jug that does not overfill the bucket. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill bucket 1 with the 141-liter jug twice, then top it off with the 20-liter jug and the 67-liter jug. This gives us 230 liters in bucket 1.
2. Fill bucket 2 with the 141-liter jug twice, then top it off with the 67-liter jug and the 20-liter jug. This gives us 267 liters in bucket 2.
3. Fill bucket 3 with the 141-liter jug twice, then top it off with the 67-liter jug and the 20-liter jug. This gives us 278 liters in bucket 3.
4. Fill bucket 4 with the 141-liter jug twice, then top it off with the 67-liter jug, the 20-liter jug, and the 15-liter jug. This gives us 318 liters in bucket 4.

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket (bucket 1). The largest jug that does not overfill it is the 68-liter jug. So, we fill bucket 1 with the 68-liter jug. The action is ('+', 68, 1).

2. Bucket 1 is not full yet (it needs 176 liters), so we fill it again with the 68-liter jug. The action is ('+', 68, 1).

3. Bucket 1 is still not full, so we fill it with the 49-liter jug. The action is ('+', 49, 1).

4. Now, bucket 1 is full, so we move to bucket 2. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the 82-liter jug. So, we fill bucket 2 with the 82-liter jug. The action is ('+', 82, 2).

5. Bucket 2 is not full yet (it needs 189 liters), so we fill it again with the 82-liter jug. The action is ('+', 82, 2).

6. Bucket 2 is still not full, so we fill it with the 25-liter jug. The action is ('+', 25, 2).

7. Now, bucket 2 is full, so we move to bucket 3. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the 88-liter jug. So, we fill bucket 3 with the 88-liter jug. The action is ('+', 88, 3).

8. Bucket 3 is not full yet (it needs 251 liters), so we fill it again with the 88-liter jug. The action is ('+', 88, 3).

9. Bucket 3 is still not full, so we fill it with the 75-liter jug. The action is ('+', 75, 3).

10. Now, bucket 3 is full, so we move to bucket 4. The largest jug that does not overfill it is the 88-liter jug. So, we fill bucket 4 with the 88-liter jug. The action is ('+', 88, 4).

11. Bucket 4 is not full yet (it needs 285 liters), so we fill it again with the 88-liter jug. The action is ('+', 88, 4).

12. Bucket 4 is still not full, so we fill it with the 88-liter jug. The action is ('+', 88, 4).

13. Bucket 4 is still not full, so we fill it with the 21-liter jug. The action is ('+', 21, 4).

14. Now, all buckets are full.

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket. We start with the largest bucket and work our way down to the smallest. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the largest bucket (bucket 4), which needs 379 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 136-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug 2 times, then use the 92-liter jug once, and finally the 23-liter jug once. This gives us the actions ('+', 136, 4), ('+', 136, 4), ('+', 92, 4), ('+', 23, 4).

2. Move on to the next largest bucket (bucket 3), which needs 326 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 136-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug 2 times, then use the 46-liter jug once, and finally the 8-liter jug once. This gives us the actions ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 46, 3), ('+', 8, 3).

3. Move on to the next largest bucket (bucket 2), which needs 293 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 136-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug 2 times, then use the 21-liter jug once. This gives us the actions ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 21, 2).

4. Finally, move on to the smallest bucket (bucket 1), which needs 209 liters of water. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 136-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug once, then use the 73-liter jug once. This gives us the actions ('+', 136, 1), ('+', 73, 1).

The final sequence of actions is therefore:

[('+', 136, 4), ('+', 136, 4), ('+', 92, 4), ('+', 23, 4), ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 46, 3), ('+', 8, 3), ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 21, 2), ('+', 136, 1), ('+', 73, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 1 with jug 128. The state is (128, 0, 0, 0).
2. Fill bucket 1 with jug 112. The state is (240, 0, 0, 0).
3. Fill bucket 2 with jug 128. The state is (240, 128, 0, 0).
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 114. The state is (240, 242, 0, 0).
5. Fill bucket 3 with jug 128. The state is (240, 242, 128, 0).
6. Fill bucket 3 with jug 118. The state is (240, 242, 246, 0).
7. Fill bucket 4 with jug 128. The state is (240, 242, 246, 128).
8. Fill bucket 4 with jug 128 again. The state is (240, 242, 246, 256).
9. Fill bucket 4 with jug 73. The state is (240, 242, 246, 329).

So, the shortest sequence of actions is:

[('+', 128, 1), ('+', 112, 1), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 114, 2), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 118, 3), ('+', 128, 4), ('+', 128, 4), ('+', 73, 4)]

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. In this case, we always choose the largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the current bucket. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Start with the first bucket. The capacity of the first bucket is 240 liters. The largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the first bucket is the jug with capacity 113 liters. So, we fill the first bucket with two jugs of 113 liters and one jug of 14 liters. The actions are ('+', 113, 1), ('+', 113, 1), ('+', 14, 1).

2. Move to the second bucket. The capacity of the second bucket is 257 liters. The largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the second bucket is the jug with capacity 131 liters. So, we fill the second bucket with two jugs of 131 liters and remove one jug of 5 liters. The actions are ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('-', 5, 2).

3. Move to the third bucket. The capacity of the third bucket is 350 liters. The largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the third bucket is the jug with capacity 147 liters. So, we fill the third bucket with two jugs of 147 liters and one jug of 56 liters. The actions are ('+', 147, 3), ('+', 147, 3), ('+', 56, 3).

4. Move to the fourth bucket. The capacity of the fourth bucket is 369 liters. The largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the fourth bucket is the jug with capacity 147 liters. So, we fill the fourth bucket with two jugs of 147 liters and one jug of 75 liters. The actions are ('+', 147, 4), ('+', 147, 4), ('+', 75, 4).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is [('+', 113, 1), ('+', 113, 1), ('+', 14, 1), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('-', 5, 2), ('+', 147, 3), ('+', 147, 3), ('+', 56, 3), ('+', 147, 4), ('+', 147, 4), ('+', 75, 4)].

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current one is full. If a jug is too large for the current bucket, we move to the next one. If a jug is too large for all remaining buckets, we discard it and choose the next largest one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket (270 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is 124 liters. Fill the bucket twice with this jug and once with the 22-liter jug. The actions are ('+', 124, 1), ('+', 124, 1), ('+', 22, 1).

2. Move to the second bucket (311 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is 124 liters. Fill the bucket twice with this jug and once with the 63-liter jug. The actions are ('+', 124, 2), ('+', 124, 2), ('+', 63, 2).

3. Move to the third bucket (372 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is 124 liters. Fill the bucket three times with this jug. The actions are ('+', 124, 3), ('+', 124, 3), ('+', 124, 3).

4. Move to the fourth bucket (389 liters). The largest jug that does not overfill it is 124 liters. Fill the bucket three times with this jug and once with the 17-liter jug. The actions are ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 17, 4).

The shortest sequence of actions is therefore:

[('+', 124, 1), ('+', 124, 1), ('+', 22, 1), ('+', 124, 2), ('+', 124, 2), ('+', 63, 2), ('+', 124, 3), ('+', 124, 3), ('+', 124, 3), ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 124, 4), ('+', 17, 4)]

The problem can be solved by filling the buckets in the order of their capacities, starting with the smallest one. We can use the jugs with the closest capacities to the required amounts of water in the buckets. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill the first bucket with 353 liters of water using the jug with capacity 116 liters three times and the jug with capacity 5 liters once. This requires 4 actions: ('+', 116, 1), ('+', 116, 1), ('+', 116, 1), ('+', 5, 1).

2. Fill the second bucket with 368 liters of water using the jug with capacity 129 liters two times and the jug with capacity 110 liters once. This requires 3 actions: ('+', 129, 2), ('+', 129, 2), ('+', 110, 2).

3. Fill the third bucket with 396 liters of water using the jug with capacity 129 liters three times and the jug with capacity 9 liters once. This requires 4 actions: ('+', 129, 3), ('+', 129, 3), ('+', 129, 3), ('+', 9, 3).

4. Fill the fourth bucket with 403 liters of water using the jug with capacity 129 liters three times and the jug with capacity 16 liters once. This requires 4 actions: ('+', 129, 4), ('+', 129, 4), ('+', 129, 4), ('+', 16, 4).

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the last bucket (bucket 4). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug. The actions are ('+', 138, 4) and ('+', 138, 4). The remaining amount of water needed is 383 - 2*138 = 107 liters.

2. The largest jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in bucket 4 is the 72-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 72, 4). The remaining amount of water needed is 107 - 72 = 35 liters.

3. The only jug that can be used to fill the remaining amount in bucket 4 is the 38-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug and then remove some water. The actions are ('+', 38, 4) and ('-', 3, 4). The remaining amount of water needed is 35 - 38 = -3 liters, which means we have to remove 3 liters of water.

4. Repeat the process for the other buckets. For bucket 3, we can use the 129-liter jug twice and the 72-liter jug once. For bucket 2, we can use the 129-liter jug twice and the 73-liter jug once. For bucket 1, we can use the 129-liter jug twice and the 38-liter jug once.

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 138, 4), ('+', 138, 4), ('+', 72, 4), ('+', 38, 4), ('-', 3, 4), ('+', 129, 3), ('+', 129, 3), ('+', 72, 3), ('+', 129, 2), ('+', 129, 2), ('+', 73, 2), ('+', 129, 1), ('+', 129, 1), ('+', 38, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The idea is to always fill the largest bucket that can be filled without violating the constraints. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Fill bucket 4 with jug 98, then with jug 98 again, and finally with jug 95. This gives us 291 liters in bucket 4. The actions are ('+', 98, 4), ('+', 98, 4), ('+', 95, 4).
2. Fill bucket 3 with jug 98, then with jug 98 again, and finally with jug 73. This gives us 269 liters in bucket 3. The actions are ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 73, 3).
3. Fill bucket 2 with jug 98, then with jug 98 again, and finally with jug 64. This gives us 260 liters in bucket 2. The actions are ('+', 98, 2), ('+', 98, 2), ('+', 64, 2).
4. Fill bucket 1 with jug 98, then with jug 98 again, and finally with jug 61. This gives us 257 liters in bucket 1. The actions are ('+', 98, 1), ('+', 98, 1), ('+', 61, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 98, 4), ('+', 98, 4), ('+', 95, 4), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 73, 3), ('+', 98, 2), ('+', 98, 2), ('+', 64, 2), ('+', 98, 1), ('+', 98, 1), ('+', 61, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. In this case, we will always choose the largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the current bucket. If the current bucket is already full, we move to the next one. 

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order: [128, 127, 125, 85, 44, 40].
2. Start with the first bucket (283 liters).
3. Find the largest jug that does not exceed the capacity of the bucket. In this case, it's the jug with 127 liters. Add it to the bucket: ('+', 127, 1).
4. The bucket now has 127 liters, and it needs 156 more liters. The largest jug that does not exceed this amount is the one with 125 liters. Add it to the bucket: ('+', 125, 1).
5. The bucket now has 252 liters, and it needs 31 more liters. The largest jug that does not exceed this amount is the one with 40 liters. However, adding this jug would violate the condition that the amount of water in each bucket cannot at any point in time exceed the amount of water in the bucket placed after it. Therefore, we move to the next bucket (295 liters).
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the remaining buckets.

Following these steps, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 127, 1), ('+', 125, 1), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 127, 2), ('+', 40, 2), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 127, 3), ('+', 85, 3), ('+', 88, 4), ('+', 127, 4), ('+', 85, 4), ('+', 128, 4)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the last bucket (bucket 4). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the one with capacity 138 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug three times. The remaining amount of water needed is 451 - 3*138 = 37 liters. The largest jug that can be used to fill this amount is the one with capacity 41 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug once. The remaining amount of water needed is 37 - 41 = -4 liters, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to backtrack and try the next largest jug, which is the one with capacity 37 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug once. The remaining amount of water needed is 0 liters, so we move on to the next bucket.

2. Move on to bucket 3. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 138 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug three times. The remaining amount of water needed is 444 - 3*138 = 30 liters. The largest jug that can be used to fill this amount is the one with capacity 30 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug once. The remaining amount of water needed is 0 liters, so we move on to the next bucket.

3. Move on to bucket 2. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 132 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug three times. The remaining amount of water needed is 401 - 3*132 = 5 liters. The largest jug that can be used to fill this amount is the one with capacity 5 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug once. The remaining amount of water needed is 0 liters, so we move on to the next bucket.

4. Move on to bucket 1. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket or any of the following buckets is the one with capacity 86 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug two times. The remaining amount of water needed is 232 - 2*86 = 60 liters. The largest jug that can be used to fill this amount is the one with capacity 60 liters. Fill the bucket with this jug once. The remaining amount of water needed is 0 liters, so we have finished filling all the buckets.

The sequence of actions is therefore:

[('+', 138, 4), ('+', 138, 4), ('+', 138, 4), ('+', 37, 4), ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 138, 3), ('+', 30, 3), ('+', 132, 2), ('+', 132, 2), ('+', 132, 2), ('+', 5, 2), ('+', 86, 1), ('+', 86, 1), ('+', 60, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or make it contain more water than the next bucket. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one.

1. Start with the 4th bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 466 liters. So, the first action is ('+', 466, 4).
2. Move to the 3rd bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 459 liters. So, the second action is ('+', 459, 3).
3. Move to the 2nd bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 375 liters. So, the third action is ('+', 375, 2).
4. Move to the 1st bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the one with capacity 294 liters. So, the fourth action is ('+', 294, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

[('+', 466, 4), ('+', 459, 3), ('+', 375, 2), ('+', 294, 1)]

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then move to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, we move to the next smaller jug. If a bucket is filled and there is still water in the jug, we move to the next bucket. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill bucket 4 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 4)
2. Fill bucket 4 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 4)
3. Fill bucket 4 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 4)
4. Fill bucket 4 with jug 6 ('+', 6, 4)
5. Fill bucket 3 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 3)
6. Fill bucket 3 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 3)
7. Fill bucket 3 with jug 125 ('+', 125, 3)

The problem can be solved by filling the buckets in order, from the smallest to the largest, and using the largest jugs first. 

1. Start by filling bucket 1 with 367 liters of water. This can be done by using the 128-liter jug three times and the 86-liter jug once. This results in the following actions: ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 128, 1), ('+', 86, 1).

2. Next, fill bucket 2 with 390 liters of water. This can be done by using the 128-liter jug three times and the 104-liter jug once. This results in the following actions: ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 128, 2), ('+', 104, 2).

3. Then, fill bucket 3 with 400 liters of water. This can be done by using the 128-liter jug three times and the 118-liter jug once. This results in the following actions: ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 128, 3), ('+', 118, 3).

4. Finally, fill bucket 4 with 470 liters of water. This can be done by using the 128-liter jug three times, the 109-liter jug once, and the 104-liter jug once. This results in the following actions: ('+', 128, 4), ('+', 128, 4), ('+', 128, 4), ('+', 109, 4), ('+', 104, 4).

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is therefore:

The problem can be solved by filling the buckets in order, from the smallest to the largest, using the jugs with the closest capacities. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill bucket 1 with the 60-liter jug and the 39-liter jug, then empty the 39-liter jug into bucket 2. This results in bucket 1 having 60 liters and bucket 2 having 39 liters.
2. Fill bucket 2 with the 59-liter jug and the 71-liter jug, then empty the 71-liter jug into bucket 3. This results in bucket 2 having 239 liters and bucket 3 having 71 liters.
3. Fill bucket 3 with the 72-liter jug, the 74-liter jug, and the 71-liter jug. This results in bucket 3 having 286 liters.
4. Fill bucket 4 with the 93-liter jug, the 84-liter jug, and the 72-liter jug, then empty the 72-liter jug into bucket 3. This results in bucket 4 having 421 liters.

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current bucket is full. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 1 with jug 136. ('+', 136, 1)
2. Fill bucket 1 with jug 136 again. ('+', 136, 1)
3. Fill bucket 1 with jug 20. ('+', 20, 1)
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 136. ('+', 136, 2)
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 136 again. ('+', 136, 2)
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 53. ('+', 53, 2)
7. Fill bucket 3 with jug 136. ('+', 136, 3)
8. Fill bucket 3 with jug 136 again. ('+', 136, 3)
9. Fill bucket 3 with jug 136 once more. ('+', 136, 3)
10. Fill bucket 3 with jug 88. ('+', 88, 3)
11. Fill bucket 4 with jug 136. ('+', 136, 4)
12. Fill bucket 4 with jug 136 again. ('+', 136, 4)
13. Fill bucket 4 with jug 136 once more. ('+', 136, 4)
14. Fill bucket 4 with jug 108. ('+', 108, 4)

So, the shortest sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the last bucket (bucket 4). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 127-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 127, 4). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 314 - 127 = 187 liters.

2. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 106-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 106, 4). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 187 - 106 = 81 liters.

3. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 42-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 42, 4). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 81 - 42 = 39 liters.

4. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 32-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 32, 4). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 39 - 32 = 7 liters.

5. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 22-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 7-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 7, 4). The bucket is now full.

6. Move to the next bucket (bucket 3). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 137-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 127-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 127, 3). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 264 - 127 = 137 liters.

7. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 137-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 137, 3). The bucket is now full.

8. Move to the next bucket (bucket 2). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 137-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 127-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 127, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 252 - 127 = 125 liters.

9. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 106-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 42-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 42, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 125 - 42 = 83 liters.

10. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 42-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 32-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 32, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 83 - 32 = 51 liters.

11. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 42-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 22-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 22, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 51 - 22 = 29 liters.

12. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 32-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 19-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 19, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 29 - 19 = 10 liters.

13. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 18-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 7-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 7, 2). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 10 - 7 = 3 liters.

14. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 7-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 3-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 3, 2). The bucket is now full.

15. Move to the first bucket (bucket 1). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 137-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 127-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 127, 1). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 245 - 127 = 118 liters.

16. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 106-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 42-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 42, 1). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 118 - 42 = 76 liters.

17. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 42-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 32-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 32, 1). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 76 - 32 = 44 liters.

18. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 42-liter jug. However, this jug would overfill the bucket. Therefore, we need to use the 22-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 22, 1). The remaining amount of water needed for this bucket is 44 - 22 = 22 liters.

19. The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 22-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug. The action is ('+', 22, 1). The bucket is now full.

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then proceeds to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, it is skipped and the next largest jug is used. If a bucket is filled and there is still water left in the jug, the water is poured into the next bucket. The algorithm continues until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order: [143, 135, 91, 82, 60, 19, 12, 11]
2. Sort the buckets in descending order: [410, 342, 288, 231]
3. Start with the largest bucket (410) and the largest jug (143). Fill the bucket with 3 jugs of water. The actions are: ('+', 143, 1), ('+', 143, 1), ('+', 143, 1).
4. Move to the next bucket (342) and the next jug (135). Fill the bucket with 2 jugs of water. The actions are: ('+', 135, 2), ('+', 135, 2).
5. Move to the next bucket (288) and the next jug (91). Fill the bucket with 3 jugs of water. The actions are: ('+', 91, 3), ('+', 91, 3), ('+', 91, 3).
6. Move to the last bucket (231) and the next jug (82). Fill the bucket with 2 jugs of water. The actions are: ('+', 82, 4), ('+', 82, 4).
7. The last bucket still needs 67 liters of water. Use the next jug (60) to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 60, 4).
8. The last bucket still needs 7 liters of water. Use the next jug (19) to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 19, 4).
9. The last bucket is overfilled by 12 liters. Empty the bucket using the same jug. The action is: ('-', 19, 4).
10. The last bucket still needs 5 liters of water. Use the next jug (12) to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 12, 4).
11. The last bucket is overfilled by 7 liters. Empty the bucket using the same jug. The action is: ('-', 12, 4).
12. The last bucket still needs 2 liters of water. Use the last jug (11) to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 11, 4).

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the first bucket and move to the next one when the current bucket is full. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the first bucket (bucket 1). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 106-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice. The actions are ('+', 106, 1) and ('+', 106, 1). The amount of water in the bucket is now 212 liters, which is more than the required 205 liters. Therefore, we need to remove some water. The smallest jug that can be used to remove the excess water is the 7-liter jug. The action is ('-', 7, 1). The amount of water in the bucket is now 205 liters, which is exactly the required amount.

2. Move to the second bucket (bucket 2). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice. The actions are ('+', 138, 2) and ('+', 138, 2). The amount of water in the bucket is now 276 liters, which is less than the required 365 liters. Therefore, we need to add more water. The largest jug that can be used to add the remaining water is the 91-liter jug. The action is ('+', 91, 2). The amount of water in the bucket is now 367 liters, which is more than the required 365 liters. Therefore, we need to remove some water. The smallest jug that can be used to remove the excess water is the 2-liter jug. The action is ('-', 2, 2). The amount of water in the bucket is now 365 liters, which is exactly the required amount.

3. Move to the third bucket (bucket 3). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug twice. The actions are ('+', 138, 3) and ('+', 138, 3). The amount of water in the bucket is now 276 liters, which is less than the required 391 liters. Therefore, we need to add more water. The largest jug that can be used to add the remaining water is the 115-liter jug. The action is ('+', 115, 3). The amount of water in the bucket is now 391 liters, which is exactly the required amount.

4. Move to the fourth bucket (bucket 4). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket is the 138-liter jug. Fill the bucket with this jug three times. The actions are ('+', 138, 4), ('+', 138, 4), and ('+', 138, 4). The amount of water in the bucket is now 414 liters, which is exactly the required amount.

The shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then proceeds to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, it is skipped and the next largest jug is used. If a bucket is filled and there is still water left in the jug, the water is poured into the next bucket. The algorithm continues until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the jugs and buckets in descending order. The sorted jugs are [149, 148, 96, 95, 81, 58, 47, 36] and the sorted buckets are [431, 412, 307, 252].

2. Start with the largest bucket (431) and the largest jug (149). Fill the bucket with the jug three times. The actions are ('+', 149, 4), ('+', 149, 4), ('+', 149, 4).

3. The bucket is overfilled, so remove the excess water using the smallest jug (36). The action is ('-', 36, 4).

4. Move to the next bucket (412) and the next largest jug (148). Fill the bucket with the jug three times. The actions are ('+', 148, 3), ('+', 148, 3), ('+', 148, 3).

5. The bucket is overfilled, so remove the excess water using the smallest jug (36). The action is ('-', 36, 3).

6. Move to the next bucket (307) and the next largest jug (96). Fill the bucket with the jug three times. The actions are ('+', 96, 2), ('+', 96, 2), ('+', 96, 2).

7. The bucket is overfilled, so remove the excess water using the smallest jug (36). The action is ('-', 36, 2).

8. Move to the last bucket (252) and the next largest jug (95). Fill the bucket with the jug three times. The actions are ('+', 95, 1), ('+', 95, 1), ('+', 95, 1).

9. The bucket is overfilled, so remove the excess water using the smallest jug (36). The action is ('-', 36, 1).

The problem can be solved by using the greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then move to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, we move to the next smaller jug. If a bucket is filled and there is still water in the jug, we move to the next bucket. If a bucket is not filled and there is no more water in the jug, we refill the jug and continue filling the bucket. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Fill bucket 4 with jug 144: ('+', 144, 4)
2. Fill bucket 4 with jug 144: ('+', 144, 4)
3. Fill bucket 4 with jug 95: ('+', 95, 4)
4. Fill bucket 4 with jug 11: ('+', 11, 4)
5. Fill bucket 3 with jug 144: ('+', 144, 3)
6. Fill bucket 3 with jug 144: ('+', 144, 3)
7. Fill bucket 3 with jug 43: ('+', 43, 3)
8. Fill bucket 2 with jug 144: ('+', 144, 2)
9. Fill bucket 2 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 2)
10. Fill bucket 2 with jug 16: ('+', 16, 2)
11. Fill bucket 1 with jug 111: ('+', 111, 1)
12. Fill bucket 1 with jug 95: ('+', 95, 1)
13. Fill bucket 1 with jug 20: ('+', 20, 1)

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the last bucket (bucket 4). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 116-liter jug. Fill the bucket twice with this jug to get 232 liters. Then, use the 98-liter jug to fill the remaining 101 liters. The actions are ('+', 116, 4), ('+', 116, 4), ('+', 98, 4).

2. Move to the third bucket (bucket 3). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 98-liter jug. Fill the bucket three times with this jug to get 294 liters. Then, use the 30-liter jug to fill the remaining 21 liters. The actions are ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 98, 3), ('+', 30, 3).

3. Move to the second bucket (bucket 2). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 76-liter jug. Fill the bucket three times with this jug to get 228 liters. Then, use the 48-liter jug to fill the remaining 41 liters. The actions are ('+', 76, 2), ('+', 76, 2), ('+', 76, 2), ('+', 48, 2).

4. Move to the first bucket (bucket 1). The largest jug that can be used without overfilling is the 48-liter jug. Fill the bucket four times with this jug to get 192 liters. Then, use the 30-liter jug to fill the remaining 9 liters. The actions are ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 48, 1), ('+', 30, 1).

The final sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then moves on to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, it is skipped and the next largest jug is used. If a bucket is filled and there is still water left in the jug, the water is poured into the next bucket. The algorithm continues until all buckets are filled.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order: [136, 110, 100, 54, 47, 41, 40, 39, 33]
2. Sort the buckets in descending order: [493, 473, 459, 192]
3. Start with the largest bucket (493) and the largest jug (136). Fill the bucket with the jug three times. This results in the actions ('+', 136, 4), ('+', 136, 4), ('+', 136, 4). The bucket now contains 408 liters of water.
4. The next largest jug (110) is too large to fill the remaining 85 liters in the bucket, so it is skipped.
5. The next largest jug (100) is also too large, so it is skipped.
6. The next largest jug (54) is too small to fill the remaining 85 liters in the bucket, so it is used. This results in the action ('+', 54, 4). The bucket now contains 462 liters of water.
7. The next largest jug (47) is too large to fill the remaining 31 liters in the bucket, so it is skipped.
8. The next largest jug (41) is too large, so it is skipped.
9. The next largest jug (40) is too large, so it is skipped.
10. The next largest jug (39) is too large, so it is skipped.
11. The smallest jug (33) is used to fill the remaining 31 liters in the bucket. This results in the action ('+', 33, 4). The bucket is now full.
12. The process is repeated for the next largest bucket (473) using the remaining jugs. The actions are ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 136, 3), ('+', 41, 3), ('+', 14, 3).
13. The process is repeated for the next largest bucket (459) using the remaining jugs. The actions are ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 136, 2), ('+', 41, 2), ('+', 10, 2).

This problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always fill the largest bucket that can be filled without violating the constraints, using the largest jug that can be used without overfilling the bucket. If no such jug exists, we empty the bucket and try again.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the largest bucket (bucket 4) and the largest jug (jug 149). Since 149 is less than 541, we can fill bucket 4 with jug 149. The action is ('+', 149, 4) and the remaining water in bucket 4 is 541 - 149 = 392 liters.

2. The next largest jug is 137, which is less than 392, so we can fill bucket 4 with jug 137. The action is ('+', 137, 4) and the remaining water in bucket 4 is 392 - 137 = 255 liters.

3. The next largest jug is 120, which is less than 255, so we can fill bucket 4 with jug 120. The action is ('+', 120, 4) and the remaining water in bucket 4 is 255 - 120 = 135 liters.

4. The next largest jug is 104, which is more than 135, so we cannot use it. We move to the next largest jug, which is 88. Since 88 is less than 135, we can fill bucket 4 with jug 88. The action is ('+', 88, 4) and the remaining water in bucket 4 is 135 - 88 = 47 liters.

5. The next largest jug is 87, which is more than 47, so we cannot use it. We move to the next largest jug, which is 81. Since 81 is more than 47, we cannot use it. We move to the next largest jug, which is 56. Since 56 is more than 47, we cannot use it. We move to the next largest jug, which is 41. Since 41 is less than 47, we can fill bucket 4 with jug 41. The action is ('+', 41, 4) and the remaining water in bucket 4 is 47 - 41 = 6 liters.

6. The next largest jug is 14, which is more than 6, so we cannot use it. We have no more jugs, so we cannot fill bucket 4 anymore. We move to the next largest bucket, which is bucket 3.

7. We repeat the process for bucket 3, bucket 2, and bucket 1.

The sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. We start by filling the largest bucket using the largest jug, then move on to the next largest bucket and so on. If a jug is too large to fill a bucket, we move on to the next largest jug. If a bucket is filled, we move on to the next bucket. If a jug is emptied, we move on to the next largest jug. We continue this process until all buckets are filled.

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 4 with jug 148 ('+', 148, 4)
2. Fill bucket 4 with jug 137 ('+', 137, 4)
3. Fill bucket 4 with jug 141 ('+', 141, 4)

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not overfill the current bucket or any of the following buckets. We start with the last bucket and move towards the first one. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the 4th bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the 462-liter jug. Fill the 4th bucket with the 462-liter jug. The action is ('+', 462, 4).

2. Move to the 3rd bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the 294-liter jug. Fill the 3rd bucket with the 294-liter jug. The action is ('+', 294, 3).

3. Move to the 2nd bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the 263-liter jug. Fill the 2nd bucket with the 263-liter jug. The action is ('+', 263, 2).

4. Move to the 1st bucket. The largest jug that can be used is the 177-liter jug. Fill the 1st bucket with the 177-liter jug. The action is ('+', 177, 1).

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not violate the constraints to fill the buckets. 

First, we sort the jugs in descending order. Then, we iterate over the buckets from left to right. For each bucket, we fill it with the largest jug that does not make it contain more water than the next bucket. If no such jug exists, we move on to the next bucket. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the jugs in descending order: [119, 105, 104, 79, 60, 59, 23, 20, 15, 14]
2. Start with the first bucket (215 liters). The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 105-liter jug. Use it twice to fill the bucket. The actions are: ('+', 105, 1), ('+', 105, 1)
3. Move on to the second bucket (403 liters). The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 119-liter jug. Use it three times to fill the bucket. The actions are: ('+', 119, 2), ('+', 119, 2), ('+', 119, 2)
4. The second bucket still needs 46 liters. The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 46-liter jug. Use it once to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 46, 2)
5. Move on to the third bucket (420 liters). The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 119-liter jug. Use it three times to fill the bucket. The actions are: ('+', 119, 3), ('+', 119, 3), ('+', 119, 3)
6. The third bucket still needs 63 liters. The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 63-liter jug. Use it once to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 63, 3)
7. Move on to the fourth bucket (504 liters). The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 119-liter jug. Use it four times to fill the bucket. The actions are: ('+', 119, 4), ('+', 119, 4), ('+', 119, 4), ('+', 119, 4)
8. The fourth bucket still needs 28 liters. The largest jug that can be used without violating the constraints is the 28-liter jug. Use it once to fill the bucket. The action is: ('+', 28, 4)

The final sequence of actions is:

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not violate the constraints to fill the buckets. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the largest bucket, which is bucket 4 with a capacity of 590 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket is the one with a capacity of 137 liters. Fill the bucket 4 times with this jug, then fill it once with the jug of 118 liters, and once with the jug of 25 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 118, 4), ('+', 25, 4).

2. Move to the next largest bucket, which is bucket 3 with a capacity of 458 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket is the one with a capacity of 131 liters. Fill the bucket 3 times with this jug, then fill it once with the jug of 65 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 65, 3).

3. Move to the next largest bucket, which is bucket 2 with a capacity of 439 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket is the one with a capacity of 131 liters. Fill the bucket 3 times with this jug, then fill it once with the jug of 46 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 46, 2).

4. Finally, move to the smallest bucket, which is bucket 1 with a capacity of 272 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket is the one with a capacity of 137 liters. Fill the bucket 2 times with this jug, then fill it once with the jug of 82 liters, and once with the jug of 16 liters. This gives us the actions ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 82, 1), ('+', 16, 1).

The final sequence of actions is therefore:

[('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 137, 4), ('+', 118, 4), ('+', 25, 4), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 131, 3), ('+', 65, 3), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 131, 2), ('+', 46, 2), ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 137, 1), ('+', 82, 1), ('+', 16, 1)]

The problem can be solved by sorting the jugs in descending order and then filling the buckets in ascending order. The jugs are filled to the top and emptied completely, so we can only use jugs that have a capacity less than or equal to the remaining capacity of the bucket. If a jug is too large, we move on to the next one. If a jug is too small, we use it and then move on to the next one. We continue this process until all the buckets are filled.

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. Fill bucket 1 with jug 107. The remaining capacity of bucket 1 is 96.
2. Fill bucket 1 with jug 68. The remaining capacity of bucket 1 is 28.
3. Fill bucket 1 with jug 32. Bucket 1 is now full.
4. Fill bucket 2 with jug 113. The remaining capacity of bucket 2 is 316.
5. Fill bucket 2 with jug 107. The remaining capacity of bucket 2 is 209.
6. Fill bucket 2 with jug 73. The remaining capacity of bucket 2 is 136.
7. Fill bucket 2 with jug 68. The remaining capacity of bucket 2 is 68.
8. Fill bucket 2 with jug 68. Bucket 2 is now full.
9. Fill bucket 3 with jug 113. The remaining capacity of bucket 3 is 320.
10. Fill bucket 3 with jug 107. The remaining capacity of bucket 3 is 213.
11. Fill bucket 3 with jug 74. The remaining capacity of bucket 3 is 139.
12. Fill bucket 3 with jug 68. The remaining capacity of bucket 3 is 71.
13. Fill bucket 3 with jug 61. The remaining capacity of bucket 3 is 10.
14. Fill bucket 3 with jug 10. Bucket 3 is now full.
15. Fill bucket 4 with jug 113. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 364.
16. Fill bucket 4 with jug 107. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 257.
17. Fill bucket 4 with jug 74. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 183.
18. Fill bucket 4 with jug 68. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 115.
19. Fill bucket 4 with jug 61. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 54.
20. Fill bucket 4 with jug 45. The remaining capacity of bucket 4 is 9.
21. Fill bucket 4 with jug 9. Bucket 4 is now full.

The solution is:

[('+', 107, 1), ('+', 68, 1), ('+', 32, 1), ('+', 113, 2), ('+', 107, 2), ('+', 73, 2), ('+', 68, 2), ('+', 68, 2), ('+', 113, 3), ('+', 107, 3), ('+', 74, 3), ('+', 68, 3), ('+', 61, 3), ('+', 10, 3), ('+', 113, 4), ('+', 107, 4), ('+', 74, 4), ('+', 68, 4), ('+', 61, 4), ('+', 45, 4), ('+', 9, 4)]

The problem can be solved by using a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the largest jug that does not violate the constraints to fill the buckets. 

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with the largest bucket, which is the 4th bucket with a capacity of 411 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket is the one with a capacity of 139 liters. Fill the 4th bucket three times with this jug. The actions are: ('+', 139, 4), ('+', 139, 4), ('+', 139, 4). Now, the 4th bucket has 417 liters, which is more than its capacity. So, we need to remove some water from it. The smallest jug that can do this is the one with a capacity of 6 liters. The action is: ('-', 6, 4). Now, the 4th bucket has exactly 411 liters.

2. Move to the 3rd bucket, which has a capacity of 312 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket without violating the constraints is the one with a capacity of 127 liters. Fill the 3rd bucket two times with this jug. The actions are: ('+', 127, 3), ('+', 127, 3). Now, the 3rd bucket has 254 liters. The next largest jug that can fill this bucket without violating the constraints is the one with a capacity of 54 liters. Fill the 3rd bucket with this jug. The action is: ('+', 54, 3). Now, the 3rd bucket has 308 liters. The next largest jug that can fill this bucket without violating the constraints is the one with a capacity of 4 liters. Fill the 3rd bucket with this jug. The action is: ('+', 4, 3). Now, the 3rd bucket has exactly 312 liters.

3. Move to the 2nd bucket, which has a capacity of 240 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket without violating the constraints is the one with a capacity of 120 liters. Fill the 2nd bucket two times with this jug. The actions are: ('+', 120, 2), ('+', 120, 2). Now, the 2nd bucket has exactly 240 liters.

4. Finally, move to the 1st bucket, which has a capacity of 219 liters. The largest jug that can fill this bucket without violating the constraints is the one with a capacity of 110 liters. Fill the 1st bucket two times with this jug. The actions are: ('+', 110, 1), ('+', 110, 1). Now, the 1st bucket has 220 liters, which is more than its capacity. So, we need to remove some water from it. The smallest jug that can do this is the one with a capacity of 1 liter. The action is: ('-', 1, 1). Now, the 1st bucket has exactly 219 liters.

So, the shortest sequence of actions needed to fill the buckets as specified is: 

[('+', 139, 4), ('+', 139, 4), ('+', 139, 4), ('-', 6, 4), ('+', 127, 3), ('+', 127, 3), ('+', 54, 3), ('+', 4, 3), ('+', 120, 2), ('+', 120, 2), ('+', 110, 1), ('+', 110, 1), ('-', 1, 1)]
