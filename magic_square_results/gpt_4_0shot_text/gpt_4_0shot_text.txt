To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers ranging from 29 to 48 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the first column. The sum of the first column should be 107 and we already have 35 in it. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 107 - 35 = 72. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. The smallest number in the range is 29, and the next smallest number is 30. The sum of 29 and 30 is 59, which is less than 72. So, we need to choose larger numbers. The next smallest numbers are 31 and 32. The sum of 31 and 32 is 63, which is still less than 72. So, we continue this process until we find two numbers whose sum is 72. The numbers are 36 and 36, but they are not unique. So, we continue and find that the numbers 37 and 35 sum to 72. But 35 is already in the grid, so we continue and find that the numbers 38 and 34 sum to 72. So, we fill the first column with 34 and 38.

Next, let's fill the first row. The sum of the first row should be 103 and we already have 35 in it. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 103 - 35 = 68. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. The smallest number in the range is 29, and the next smallest number is 30. The sum of 29 and 30 is 59, which is less than 68. So, we need to choose larger numbers. The next smallest numbers are 31 and 32. The sum of 31 and 32 is 63, which is still less than 68. So, we continue this process until we find two numbers whose sum is 68. The numbers are 34 and 34, but they are not unique. So, we continue and find that the numbers 35 and 33 sum to 68. But 35 is already in the grid, so we continue and find that the numbers 36 and 32 sum to 68. So, we fill the first row with 32 and 36.

Finally, let's fill the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of the numbers in this diagonal should be 124 and we already have 46 in it. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 124 - 46 = 78. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. The smallest number in the range is 29, and the next smallest number is 30. The sum of 29 and 30 is 59, which is less than 78. So, we need to choose larger numbers. The next smallest numbers are 31 and 32. The sum of 31 and 32 is 63, which is still less than 78. So, we continue this process until we find two numbers whose sum is 78. The numbers are 39 and 39, but they are not unique. So, we continue and find that the numbers 40 and 38 sum to 78. But 38 is already in the grid, so we continue and find that the numbers 41 and 37 sum to 78. So, we fill the diagonal with 37 and 41.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 20 to 39 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling the grid with the lowest possible numbers, starting from 20. 

First, we know that the sum of column 1 must be 82. Since we already have a 30 in that column, we need to find two other numbers that add up to 52. The two smallest numbers that add up to 52 are 20 and 32. We can put 20 in row 0 and 32 in row 2.

Next, we know that the sum of row 1 must be 87. We already have a 30 in that row, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 57. The two smallest numbers that add up to 57, and that are not already in the grid, are 21 and 36. We can put 21 in column 1 and 36 in column 2.

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 94. We already have a 36 in that diagonal, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 58. The two smallest numbers that add up to 58, and that are not already in the grid, are 22 and 36. However, 36 is already in the grid, so we need to use the next smallest number, which is 37. We can put 22 in row 0, column 2 and 37 in row 2, column 0.

So, the final grid is:
 [[20, 21, 22]
 [30, 36, 'x']
 [37, 32, 'x']]

We still have two 'x's in the grid. We can replace them with the two smallest numbers that are not already in the grid, which are 23 and 24. We can put 23 in row 1, column 2 and 24 in row 2, column 2.

So, the final grid is:
 [[20, 21, 22]
 [30, 36, 23]
 [37, 32, 24]]

The solution as a list of tuples is: [(0, 0, 20), (0, 1, 21), (0, 2, 22), (2, 0, 37), (2, 1, 32), (1, 2, 23), (2, 2, 24)].

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that replace the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's identify the positions of the 'x's in the grid. 

The 'x's are located at the following positions: 
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- (2,1), (2,2)

Next, we need to find the unique integers that replace these 'x's. 

We know that the sum of column 1 must be 82, and the sum of row 1 must also be 82. We also know that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 82. 

Given that the only number in the grid is 22 (at position (2,0)), we can calculate the remaining numbers as follows:

- For column 1 to sum to 82, the numbers at positions (0,1) and (1,1) must sum to 60 (82 - 22). To keep the total sum as low as possible, we can choose the smallest available numbers, 20 and 40. 

- For row 1 to sum to 82, the numbers at positions (1,0) and (1,2) must sum to 42 (82 - 40). Again, to keep the total sum as low as possible, we can choose the smallest available numbers, 21 and 21. 

- For the diagonal to sum to 82, the number at position (0,2) must be 39 (82 - 22 - 21). 

- The remaining positions (0,0) and (2,2) can be filled with the smallest available numbers, 23 and 24. 

So, the final grid would look like this:

 [[23, 20, 39]
 [21, 40, 21]
 [22, 24, 24]]

And the solution as a list of tuples would be:

/answer_list/ [(0,0,23), (0,1,20), (0,2,39), (1,0,21), (1,1,40), (1,2,21), (2,1,24), (2,2,24)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers ranging from 19 to 43 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the first column. The sum of the first column should be 82. We already have 'x' in the first position, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 82. The smallest two numbers that add up to 82 are 19 and 63. However, 63 is not in the range 19 to 43. So, we need to find the next smallest pair of numbers that add up to 82 and are within the range 19 to 43. The pair of numbers that meet these criteria are 19 and 43. We can put 19 in the first position and 43 in the second position.

Next, let's fill in the first row. The sum of the first row should be 82. We already have 20 in the second position, so we need to find a number that when added to 20 and 19 (from the first column) equals 82. The number that meets this criteria is 43.

Finally, let's fill in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of the numbers in this diagonal should be 96. We already have 33 in the bottom left position, so we need to find a number that when added to 33 and 43 (from the first row) equals 96. The number that meets this criteria is 20.

So, the final grid looks like this:
 [['19' '20' '43']
 ['43' 'x' 'x']
 ['33' 'x' '33']]

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. The sum of the given numbers is 37 + 26 = 63.

The sum of all numbers in the 3x3 grid is 3 * (19 + 20 + 21) = 180. 

The sum of the remaining numbers is 180 - 63 = 117.

The sum of the first column is 111, and we already have 37 in that column. So, the sum of the remaining numbers in the first column is 111 - 37 = 74. 

The sum of the first row is 94, and we already have 63 in that row. So, the sum of the remaining number in the first row is 94 - 63 = 31.

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is 82, and we already have 26 in that diagonal. So, the sum of the remaining numbers in the diagonal is 82 - 26 = 56.

Now, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy these conditions. 

The smallest possible unique integers that can be used are 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 

We can assign 19 to the position (1, 0), 20 to the position (2, 0), 21 to the position (1, 1), 22 to the position (2, 1), 23 to the position (1, 2), and 24 to the position (2, 2).

These assignments satisfy all the given conditions.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 35 to 59 such that the sum of column 1 is 130, the sum of row 1 is 144, and the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner is 123. We also need to ensure that the sum of all the numbers in the grid is as low as possible.

First, let's fill the first column. We know that the sum of the first column should be 130 and we already have 52 in the first row. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 130 - 52 = 78. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range 35 to 59 that add up to 78. These numbers are 35 and 43. We can put 35 in the second row and 43 in the third row.

Next, let's fill the first row. We know that the sum of the first row should be 144 and we already have 52 in the first column. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 144 - 52 = 92. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the remaining range that add up to 92. These numbers are 36 and 56. We can put 36 in the second column and 56 in the third column.

Finally, let's fill the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner. We know that the sum of this diagonal should be 123 and we already have 56 in the first row. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 123 - 56 = 67. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the remaining range that add up to 67. These numbers are 37 and 30. We can put 37 in the second row and 30 in the third row.

So, the final grid is:
 [['52' '36' '56']
 ['35' '37' 'x']
 ['43' 'x' '30']]

The remaining 'x's can be filled with the smallest remaining numbers from the range 35 to 59. These numbers are 38 and 39. We can put 38 in the second row and 39 in the third row.

So, the final grid is:
 [['52' '36' '56']
 ['35' '37' '38']
 ['43' '39' '30']]

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. There is only one given number, 37, so the sum is 37.

The sum of all numbers in the grid is the sum of three rows, three columns, and two diagonals. Since each number is counted three times (once in a row, once in a column, and once in a diagonal), the total sum of the grid is three times the sum of all numbers in the grid. Therefore, the sum of all numbers in the grid is (125 + 157 + 138) / 3 = 140.

The sum of the unknown numbers is the total sum minus the sum of the given numbers, which is 140 - 37 = 103.

Now, let's find the unique integers that add up to 103. Since we want the sum to be as low as possible, we should start with the smallest numbers in the given range. The smallest numbers are 35, 36, 38, and 39. Their sum is 148, which is greater than 103. Therefore, we need to replace one of them with a smaller number. The smallest number that can be replaced is 39, and it can be replaced with 34 to make the sum equal to 103.

Now, let's assign these numbers to the 'x's in the grid. The number in the first row and first column should be 35, because the sum of the first column is 125 and the sum of the first row is 157. The number in the first row and second column should be 36, because the sum of the second column is 157 - 35 = 122 and the sum of the first row is 157 - 35 = 122. The number in the first row and third column should be 38, because the sum of the third column is 138 - 37 = 101 and the sum of the first row is 157 - 35 - 36 = 86. The number in the second row and first column should be 34, because the sum of the first column is 125 - 35 = 90 and the sum of the second row is 157 - 38 = 119.

Therefore, the solution is [(0, 0, 35), (0, 1, 36), (0, 2, 38), (1, 0, 34)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that will replace the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's denote the unknowns in the grid as follows:

 [['a' 'b' 'c']
 ['d' 'e' 'f']
 ['g' 'h' '57']]

From the problem, we know that:

1. The sum of column 1 is 154, so a + d + g = 154.
2. The sum of row 1 is 151, so d + e + f = 151.
3. The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is 133, so c + e + g = 133.

We also know that all the numbers in the grid are unique and range from 35 to 59. 

Since we want the sum of all the numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the unknowns. 

Let's start with 'a'. Since 'a' is in the first column, it should be as small as possible. The smallest number in the range is 35, so let's assign 'a' = 35.

Next, let's assign 'd'. 'd' is also in the first column, so it should also be as small as possible. The next smallest number in the range is 36, so let's assign 'd' = 36.

Now, we can calculate 'g'. From the first equation, we know that a + d + g = 154. Substituting 'a' and 'd', we get 35 + 36 + g = 154, so g = 154 - 35 - 36 = 83.

Next, let's assign 'b'. 'b' is in the second column, so it should also be as small as possible. The next smallest number in the range is 37, so let's assign 'b' = 37.

Now, we can calculate 'e'. From the second equation, we know that d + e + f = 151. Substituting 'd', we get 36 + e + f = 151, so e = 151 - 36 - f. Since we want 'e' to be as small as possible, we should assign 'f' the largest possible value. The largest number in the range is 59, so let's assign 'f' = 59. Substituting 'f', we get e = 151 - 36 - 59 = 56.

Finally, we can calculate 'c'. From the third equation, we know that c + e + g = 133. Substituting 'e' and 'g', we get c + 56 + 83 = 133, so c = 133 - 56 - 83 = -6.

However, 'c' cannot be negative, so we made a mistake. The mistake is that 'g' cannot be 83 because it's out of the range 35 to 59. So, we need to adjust the values of 'a', 'd', and 'g' such that a + d + g = 154 and all of them are within the range.

Let's try 'a' = 36, 'd' = 37, and 'g' = 81. These values are within the range and their sum is 154. 

Now, let's try 'b' = 38, 'e' = 39, and 'f' = 59. These values are within the range and their sum is 136, which is less than 151. So, we need to adjust the values of 'e' and 'f' such that d + e + f = 151 and all of them are within the range.

Let's try 'e' = 40 and 'f' = 59. These values are within the range and their sum is 136, which is still less than 151. So, we need to adjust the value of 'f' such that d + e + f = 151.

Let's try 'f' = 74. This value is within the range and d + e + f = 151.

Finally, let's try 'c' = 35. This value is within the range and c + e + g = 133.

So, the solution is:

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. We have 46 and 39, so the sum is 85.

The sum of all numbers in the grid should be as low as possible, so we should use the smallest numbers available. The smallest numbers in the range 28 to 57 that are not already in the grid are 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 57.

The sum of column 1 must be 126. We already have 46 in this column, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 80. The smallest numbers that satisfy this condition are 28 and 52.

The sum of row 1 must be 124. We already have 39 in this row, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 85. The smallest numbers that satisfy this condition are 28 and 57. However, 28 is already used in column 1, so we need to use the next smallest numbers, which are 29 and 56.

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 136. We already have 46 in this diagonal, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 90. The smallest numbers that satisfy this condition are 28 and 62. However, 28 is already used in column 1, so we need to use the next smallest numbers, which are 29 and 61. However, 29 is already used in row 1, so we need to use the next smallest numbers, which are 30 and 60. However, 30 is not in the range 28 to 57, so we need to use the next smallest numbers, which are 31 and 59.

Therefore, the solution is [(0, 0, 31), (0, 2, 59), (1, 1, 29), (1, 2, 56), (2, 0, 52), (2, 1, 28), (2, 2, 47)].

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the missing numbers in the first column. The sum of the first column should be 129. We already have 41 and 34 in the first column, so the missing number in the first column (at position (2,0)) is 129 - 41 - 34 = 54.

Next, let's find the missing numbers in the first row. The sum of the first row should be 133. We already have 41 in the first row, so the sum of the missing numbers in the first row is 133 - 41 = 92. Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest available numbers for the missing numbers in the first row. The smallest available numbers (excluding 54 which we have already used) are 28 and 29. However, if we choose 28 and 29, the sum would be 57 which is less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 30. Now, if we choose 28 and 30, the sum would be 58 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 31. Now, if we choose 28 and 31, the sum would be 59 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 32. Now, if we choose 28 and 32, the sum would be 60 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 33. Now, if we choose 28 and 33, the sum would be 61 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 35. Now, if we choose 28 and 35, the sum would be 63 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 36. Now, if we choose 28 and 36, the sum would be 64 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 37. Now, if we choose 28 and 37, the sum would be 65 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 38. Now, if we choose 28 and 38, the sum would be 66 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 39. Now, if we choose 28 and 39, the sum would be 67 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 40. Now, if we choose 28 and 40, the sum would be 68 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 42. Now, if we choose 28 and 42, the sum would be 70 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 43. Now, if we choose 28 and 43, the sum would be 71 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 44. Now, if we choose 28 and 44, the sum would be 72 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 45. Now, if we choose 28 and 45, the sum would be 73 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 46. Now, if we choose 28 and 46, the sum would be 74 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 47. Now, if we choose 28 and 47, the sum would be 75 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 48. Now, if we choose 28 and 48, the sum would be 76 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 49. Now, if we choose 28 and 49, the sum would be 77 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 50. Now, if we choose 28 and 50, the sum would be 78 which is still less than 92. So, we need to choose the next smallest number which is 51. Now, if we choose

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers ranging from 28 to 57 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling the grid with the lowest possible numbers, starting from 28, and then adjust the numbers as needed to meet the sum requirements.

First, we fill the grid with the lowest possible numbers:

 [['28' '32' '29']
 ['38' '30' '31']
 ['32' '33' '34']]

Now, we need to adjust the numbers to meet the sum requirements. 

The sum of column 1 is currently 95, but it needs to be 143. So, we need to increase the numbers in column 1 by a total of 48. We can do this by increasing the number in row 0, column 1 from 32 to 80.

The sum of row 1 is currently 99, but it needs to be 134. So, we need to increase the numbers in row 1 by a total of 35. We can do this by increasing the number in row 1, column 2 from 31 to 66.

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is currently 92, but it needs to be 131. So, we need to increase the numbers in this diagonal by a total of 39. We can do this by increasing the number in row 2, column 0 from 32 to 71.

Now, the grid looks like this:

 [['28' '80' '29']
 ['38' '30' '66']
 ['71' '33' '34']]

And the sum requirements are met. 

So, the solution is:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. There is only one given number, 55, in the grid. 

Next, we need to find the total sum of all the numbers in the grid. Since the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same in a magic square, we can find the total sum by multiplying the sum of one row, column, or diagonal by 3. 

The sum of column 1 is 190, so the total sum of the grid is 190 * 3 = 570. 

Subtracting the sum of the given numbers from the total sum gives us the sum of the numbers we need to find: 570 - 55 = 515. 

Now, let's distribute this sum among the 'x's in the grid. 

The sum of row 1 is 167, and it already contains the number 55, so the sum of the two 'x's in row 1 is 167 - 55 = 112. 

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is 172, and it doesn't contain any given numbers, so the sum of the three 'x's in this diagonal is 172. 

The sum of column 1 is 190, and it doesn't contain any given numbers, so the sum of the three 'x's in column 1 is 190. 

We can see that the sum of the 'x's in row 1 and column 1 is greater than the total sum we need to find, so we need to adjust the numbers. 

Let's assign the smallest possible numbers to the 'x's in row 1 and column 1. The smallest possible numbers in the range 48 to 77 are 48, 49, and 50. 

Assigning 48 and 49 to the 'x's in row 1 gives us a sum of 48 + 49 = 97, which is less than 112, so we can assign the remaining 15 to the 'x' in the intersection of row 1 and column 1. 

Assigning 50 to the 'x' in column 1 gives us a sum of 50 + 15 = 65, which is less than 190, so we can assign the remaining 125 to the 'x's in the intersection of column 1 and the diagonal. 

Finally, we can assign the remaining sum to the 'x's in the diagonal. The remaining sum is 515 - 97 - 65 = 353, which we can distribute among the three 'x's in the diagonal. 

The smallest possible numbers in the range 48 to 77 that we haven't used yet are 51, 52, and 53. Assigning these numbers to the 'x's in the diagonal gives us a sum of 51 + 52 + 53 = 156, which is less than 353, so we can assign the remaining 197 to the 'x' in the intersection of the diagonal and column 1. 

This gives us the following assignments: 

- (0, 0): 48
- (0, 1): 49
- (1, 0): 50
- (1, 1): 15
- (2, 0): 125

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's consider the sum of column 1 and row 1. The sum of column 1 is 200 and the sum of row 1 is 191. Since the number 66 is already given in row 1, the remaining two numbers in row 1 must sum to 191 - 66 = 125. Similarly, since there are no given numbers in column 1, the three numbers in column 1 must sum to 200. 

Next, let's consider the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of this diagonal is 201. Since the number 66 is already given in this diagonal, the remaining two numbers in the diagonal must sum to 201 - 66 = 135. 

Now, let's find the unique integers that satisfy these conditions. We know that the numbers must be in the range from 48 to 77. 

The lowest possible sum for the grid would be achieved by using the smallest possible numbers. So, let's start by assigning the smallest number, 48, to the position (0, 0). 

Then, the number in position (1, 0) would be 200 - 48 = 152. But this number is out of the given range. So, we need to increase the number in position (0, 0). Let's try the next smallest number, 49. Then, the number in position (1, 0) would be 200 - 49 = 151, which is still out of the range. 

We continue this process until we find a number for position (0, 0) that makes the number in position (1, 0) fall within the range. This happens when the number in position (0, 0) is 54. Then, the number in position (1, 0) is 200 - 54 = 146, which is within the range. 

Next, we need to find the number for position (0, 1). This number must be such that the sum of the numbers in row 1 is 191 and the sum of the numbers in the diagonal is 201. Since the numbers in positions (1, 2) and (0, 0) are already given, the number in position (0, 1) must be 191 - 66 - 54 = 71. 

Finally, we need to find the number for position (2, 1). This number must be such that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal is 201. Since the numbers in positions (1, 2) and (0, 1) are already given, the number in position (2, 1) must be 201 - 66 - 71 = 64. 

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 54), (1, 0, 146), (0, 1, 71), (2, 1, 64)].

Let's start by filling the grid with the lowest possible numbers, starting from 48. 

First, we know that the sum of column 1 must be 166. Since we already have a 52 in that column, we need to find two other numbers that, when added to 52, equal 166. The two lowest numbers that satisfy this condition are 48 and 66. We'll place the 48 in row 1, column 1 and the 66 in row 2, column 1. 

Next, we know that the sum of row 1 must be 192. We already have a 48 in that row, so we need to find two other numbers that, when added to 48, equal 192. The two lowest numbers that satisfy this condition are 49 and 95. We'll place the 49 in row 1, column 0 and the 95 in row 1, column 2. 

Finally, we know that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 184. We already have a 49 in that diagonal, so we need to find two other numbers that, when added to 49, equal 184. The two lowest numbers that satisfy this condition are 50 and 85. We'll place the 50 in row 0, column 2 and the 85 in row 2, column 0. 

The final grid looks like this: 
 [['50' '52' '49']
 ['48' 'x' '95']
 ['85' '66' 'x']]

So, the solution to the problem is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's calculate the sum of the given numbers in the grid. The only given number is 70.

Next, we need to find the sum of all numbers in the grid. Since the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is given, we can calculate the total sum by adding the sum of the first column, the sum of the second row, and the sum of the diagonal. This gives us 191 + 194 + 186 = 571.

Subtracting the sum of the given numbers from the total sum gives us the sum of the numbers we need to find. This is 571 - 70 = 501.

Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest unique integers in the given range that add up to 501. The smallest unique integers in the range 48 to 77 that add up to 501 are 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, and 59. However, since we only need to replace 8 'x's in the grid, we should remove the 4 largest numbers from this list. This leaves us with 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.

Now, we need to assign these numbers to the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts. 

We can start by assigning the smallest number, 48, to the first 'x' in the first row. This leaves us with 143 for the rest of the column, 146 for the rest of the row, and 138 for the rest of the diagonal.

Next, we can assign the next smallest number, 49, to the second 'x' in the first row. This leaves us with 97 for the rest of the column, 97 for the rest of the row, and 89 for the rest of the diagonal.

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the value for the first row, third column. We know that the sum of the first row must be 201, and we already have two numbers: 64 and 78. So, the third number would be 201 - 64 - 78 = 59.

Next, let's find the value for the second row, first column. We know that the sum of the first column must be 234, and we already have one number: 64. So, the second number would be 234 - 64 - 59 = 111, which is out of the given range. This means that we need to adjust the value we found for the first row, third column. Let's increase it to the next available number, 60. Then, the second number for the first column would be 234 - 64 - 60 = 110, which is still out of the given range. We continue this process until we find a number in the given range. If we increase the first row, third column number to 61, the second number for the first column would be 234 - 64 - 61 = 109, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the first row, third column number to 62, the second number for the first column would be 234 - 64 - 62 = 108, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the first row, third column number to 63, the second number for the first column would be 234 - 64 - 63 = 107, which is in the given range.

Finally, let's find the value for the third row, third column. We know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 213, and we already have two numbers: 78 and 107. So, the third number would be 213 - 78 - 107 = 28, which is out of the given range. This means that we need to adjust the value we found for the second row, first column. Let's increase it to the next available number, 108. Then, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 108 = 27, which is still out of the given range. We continue this process until we find a number in the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 109, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 109 = 26, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 110, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 110 = 25, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 111, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 111 = 24, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 112, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 112 = 23, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 113, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 113 = 22, which is still out of the given range. If we increase the second row, first column number to 114, the third number for the diagonal would be 213 - 78 - 114 = 21, which is still out of the given range.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. We have 62 and 82, so the sum is 144.

The total sum of all numbers in the grid should be as low as possible. Since the numbers range from 50 to 84, we should start from the lowest number, 50. 

The sum of column 1 should be 233. Since we already have 82 in this column, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 233 - 82 = 151. The two numbers should be unique and as low as possible, so we choose 50 and 101. 

The sum of row 1 should be 207. Since we already have 62 in this row, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 207 - 62 = 145. The two numbers should be unique and as low as possible, so we choose 50 and 95. 

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left should be 185. Since we already have 82 in this diagonal, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 185 - 82 = 103. The two numbers should be unique and as low as possible, so we choose 50 and 53. 

Now, we have the following grid:

 [['62' '82' '50']
 ['50' '101' '95']
 ['53' '50' 'x']]

The last 'x' should be a unique number that makes the sum of all numbers in the grid as low as possible. The next lowest number that we haven't used yet is 54. So, we replace the last 'x' with 54.

Finally, we have the following grid:

 [['62' '82' '50']
 ['50' '101' '95']
 ['53' '50' '54']]

So, the solution is [(0, 2, 50), (1, 0, 50), (1, 1, 101), (1, 2, 95), (2, 0, 53), (2, 1, 50), (2, 2, 54)].

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's consider the sum of column 1 and row 1. The sum of column 1 is 212 and the only known number in this column is 56. So, the sum of the two 'x' values in column 1 is 212 - 56 = 156. 

Similarly, the sum of row 1 is 193 and the only known number in this row is 62. So, the sum of the two 'x' values in row 1 is 193 - 62 = 131. 

Now, let's consider the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of this diagonal is 217 and the only known number in this diagonal is 62. So, the sum of the two 'x' values in this diagonal is 217 - 62 = 155. 

From these calculations, we can see that the 'x' value at position (1, 0) must be 131 - 155 = -24, which is not possible as the numbers should be between 50 and 84. 

Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's consider the sum of column 1. The sum of column 1 is 120 and we already have 43 in that column. So, the sum of the other two numbers in column 1 should be 120 - 43 = 77. Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the given range (12 to 46) that add up to 77. These numbers are 34 and 43. But 43 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number which is 35. So, the numbers in column 1 are 35, 'x', and 43.

Next, let's consider the sum of row 1. The sum of row 1 is 105 and we already have 35 in that row. So, the sum of the other two numbers in row 1 should be 105 - 35 = 70. Again, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the given range that add up to 70. These numbers are 34 and 36. But 34 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest numbers which are 35 and 36. But 35 is also in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number which is 37. So, the numbers in row 1 are 35, 37, and 'x'.

Finally, let's consider the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of this diagonal is 99 and we already have 43 in that diagonal. So, the sum of the other two numbers in this diagonal should be 99 - 43 = 56. Again, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the given range that add up to 56. These numbers are 12 and 44. But 12 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number which is 13. So, the numbers in this diagonal are 'x', 43, and 13.

Finally, let's look at the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of this diagonal must be 70. Since we already have 57 in the first row and 19 in the third row, we need to find a number that is -6 (70 - 57 - 19).

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. We have only two numbers: 42 and 45. Their sum is 87.

The total sum of all numbers in the grid is the sum of the sums of each column or each row or the two diagonals. Since we have a 3x3 grid, the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal should be the same. We know that the sum of column 1 is 115 and the sum of row 1 is 95. The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner is 133. 

The sum of all numbers in the grid is 3 times the sum of a row, a column, or a diagonal. So, the total sum of all numbers in the grid is 3*115 = 345.

Now, we subtract the sum of the given numbers from the total sum to find the sum of the numbers that will replace 'x'. So, 345 - 87 = 258. 

We need to distribute this sum among the 'x's in such a way that the sum of column 1, row 1, and the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner are 115, 95, and 133 respectively. 

Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should use the smallest unique integers in the given range (9 to 48) to replace 'x'. 

Let's start with the first row. We know that the sum of row 1 should be 95. We already have 'x' in the first and second positions of this row. So, we need to find two numbers that sum up to 95 - 'x' in the third position of the first row. The smallest two numbers that satisfy this condition are 9 and 86. 

Next, we move to the first column. We know that the sum of column 1 should be 115. We already have 42 in the third position of this column. So, we need to find two numbers that sum up to 115 - 42 = 73. The smallest two numbers that satisfy this condition are 10 and 63. 

Finally, we move to the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner. We know that the sum of this diagonal should be 133. We already have 45 in the second position of this diagonal. So, we need to find two numbers that sum up to 133 - 45 = 88. The smallest two numbers that satisfy this condition are 11 and 77. 

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 9), (0, 1, 86), (1, 0, 10), (1, 1, 63), (2, 2, 11), (2, 1, 77)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers ranging from 9 to 48 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling in the first column. The sum of the first column should be 67 and we already have 45 in the third row. So, the sum of the first two rows should be 67 - 45 = 22. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we should choose the smallest possible numbers for the first two rows. The smallest number available is 9, so we can fill in the first row with 9 and the second row with 22 - 9 = 13.

Next, let's fill in the first row. The sum of the first row should be 60 and we already have 9 and 16 in the first and second columns. So, the third column should be 60 - 9 - 16 = 35.

Finally, let's fill in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of the diagonal should be 89 and we already have 16 and 45 in the second and third rows. So, the first row should be 89 - 16 - 45 = 28.

So, the final grid is:
 [[9 16 35]
 [13 'x' 'x']
 [45 'x' 28]]

The solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. There is only one given number, 32, so the sum is 32.

The sum of all numbers in the grid should be the sum of three times any row, column or diagonal. Let's use the first column for this purpose. The sum of the first column is 150, so the sum of all numbers in the grid is 3 * 150 = 450.

The sum of the unknown numbers is the difference between the sum of all numbers and the sum of the given numbers, which is 450 - 32 = 418.

Now, let's distribute this sum among the unknown numbers. We need to minimize the sum, so we should use the smallest possible unique numbers. The smallest unique numbers in the range from 26 to 65 are 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.

We need to find 8 numbers from this list that add up to 418 and satisfy the conditions for the sums of the first column, the first row, and the diagonal. 

The sum of the first column is 150, so the sum of the unknown numbers in the first column is 150 - 32 = 118. The smallest two numbers that add up to 118 are 26 and 92.

The sum of the first row is 135, so the sum of the unknown numbers in the first row is 135. The smallest two numbers that add up to 135 are 27 and 108.

The sum of the diagonal is 119, so the sum of the unknown numbers in the diagonal is 119 - 32 = 87. The smallest two numbers that add up to 87 are 28 and 59.

The remaining two numbers are the smallest numbers from the list that have not been used yet, which are 29 and 30.

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 26), (0, 1, 27), (0, 2, 92), (1, 0, 28), (1, 1, 108), (1, 2, 29), (2, 0, 59), (2, 2, 30)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers ranging from 26 to 65 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Step 1: We know that the sum of column 1 must be 93. Since the first cell in column 1 is already filled with 47, the remaining two cells must sum up to 93 - 47 = 46. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should fill these cells with the smallest available numbers. The smallest available numbers are 26 and 27, which sum up to 53, which is more than 46. Therefore, we cannot fill these cells with the smallest available numbers. The next smallest numbers are 28 and 29, which sum up to 57, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 30 and 31, which sum up to 61, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 32 and 33, which sum up to 65, which is still more than 46.

The next smallest numbers are 42 and 43, which sum up to 85, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 44 and 45, which sum up to 89, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 46 and 47, which sum up to 93, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 48 and 49, which sum up to 97, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 50 and 51, which sum up to 101, which is still more than 46. The next smallest numbers are 52 and 53, which sum up to 105, which is still more than 46.

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers ranging from 34 to 78 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling the grid with the lowest possible numbers, starting from 34, and then adjust the numbers as needed to meet the sum requirements.

First, we know that the sum of column 1 must be 180, and we already have 77 in that column. So, the remaining two numbers in that column must sum to 180 - 77 = 103. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we'll start by assigning the lowest available numbers to these positions. So, we'll put 34 in row 1, column 1 and 35 in row 2, column 1.

Next, we know that the sum of row 1 must be 156, and we already have 49 in that row. So, the remaining two numbers in that row must sum to 156 - 49 = 107. We've already assigned 34 to one of these positions, so the remaining number must be 107 - 34 = 73. We'll put this number in row 1, column 2.

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left must be 127. We already have 73 in this diagonal, so the remaining two numbers must sum to 127 - 73 = 54. We've already assigned 34 to one of these positions, so the remaining number must be 54 - 34 = 20. However, this number is not in the range 34 to 78. Therefore, we need to adjust the numbers we've assigned so far.

Let's increase the number in row 1, column 1 from 34 to 36. This will increase the sum of column 1 to 182, which is still acceptable. It will also increase the sum of row 1 to 158, which is still acceptable. However, it will increase the sum of the diagonal to 128, which is not acceptable. So, we need to decrease the number in row 1, column 2 from 73 to 71. This will decrease the sum of row 1 to 156, which is acceptable. It will also decrease the sum of the diagonal to 127, which is acceptable.

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions in the grid. We'll put the lowest available number, 37, in row 2, column 2. Then, we'll put the next lowest available number, 38, in row 2, column 0. Finally, we'll put the next lowest available number, 39, in row 0, column 0.

So, the final grid is:
 [[39 77 71]
 [49 36 37]
 [38 35 34]]

And the list of tuples representing the 'x' positions and their replacements is:

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's look at the sum of column 1 and row 1. The sum of column 1 is 172 and the only known number in this column is 38. So, the sum of the two 'x's in column 1 is 172 - 38 = 134. 

The sum of row 1 is 212 and the only known number in this row is 59. So, the sum of the two 'x's in row 1 is 212 - 59 = 153.

Now, let's look at the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of this diagonal is 165 and the only known number in this diagonal is 59. So, the sum of the two 'x's in this diagonal is 165 - 59 = 106.

From these calculations, we can see that the 'x' at position (1, 0) is included in both the sum of column 1 and row 1. So, its value should be the intersection of the two sums, which is 153 - 134 = 19.

The 'x' at position (1, 1) is included in all three sums. So, its value should be the intersection of the three sums, which is 134 - 19 = 115.

The 'x' at position (1, 2) is included in the sum of row 1 and the diagonal. So, its value should be the intersection of these two sums, which is 153 - 19 = 134.

The 'x' at position (2, 1) is included in the sum of column 1 and the diagonal. So, its value should be the intersection of these two sums, which is 134 - 115 = 19.

The 'x' at position (2, 2) is included in the sum of column 1. So, its value should be the remaining sum of column 1, which is 134 - 115 - 19 = 0. However, the value 0 is not in the given range from 34 to 78. Therefore, we need to adjust the values to fit the given range.

Let's increase the value of (1, 0) by 15 to 34, the minimum value in the given range. We also need to increase the value of (1, 1) and (1, 2) by 15 to maintain the sum of row 1. So, the new values are 34, 130, and 149, respectively.

Then, we need to decrease the value of (2, 1) by 15 to 4, which is below the given range. So, we increase it to 34, the minimum value in the given range. We also need to decrease the value of (2, 2) by 15 to maintain the sum of column 1. So, the new value is -15, which is also below the given range. Therefore, we increase it to 34, the minimum value in the given range.

Finally, we need to adjust the value of (1, 2) to maintain the sum of the diagonal. The new value is 149 - 34 - 34 = 81, which is in the given range.

So, the final solution is [(1, 0, 34), (1, 1, 130), (1, 2, 81), (2, 1, 34), (2, 2, 34)].

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is correct!! LLM solution is NOT optimal 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that replace the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's denote the unknowns in the grid as follows:

[['a' 'b' 'c']
 ['d' '73' '47']
 ['e' 'f' 'g']]

We know that the sum of column 1 is 177, so we have the equation: b + 73 + f = 177. Solving for f, we get f = 177 - 73 - b = 104 - b.

We also know that the sum of row 1 is 180, so we have the equation: d + 73 + 47 = 180. Solving for d, we get d = 180 - 73 - 47 = 60.

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 183, so we have the equation: c + 73 + e = 183. Solving for e, we get e = 183 - 73 - c = 110 - c.

Since we want the sum of all the numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest possible unique integers for a, b, c, and g. The smallest possible unique integers in the range 34 to 78 that are not already in the grid (73 and 47) are 34, 35, 36, and 37. 

We can assign these values to a, b, c, and g in any order, but we need to make sure that the value we assign to b does not make f less than 34 (since f = 104 - b and f must be in the range 34 to 78), and the value we assign to c does not make e less than 34 (since e = 110 - c and e must be in the range 34 to 78). 

If we assign 34 to a, 35 to b, 36 to c, and 37 to g, then f = 104 - 35 = 69 and e = 110 - 36 = 74, which are both in the range 34 to 78. 

So, the solution is a = 34, b = 35, c = 36, d = 60, e = 74, f = 69, and g = 37.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that will replace the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling in the grid with the lowest possible unique integers from the given range (31 to 75) that satisfy the given conditions.

First, we know that the sum of column 1 must be 135 and we already have 41 in that column. So, the sum of the two 'x's in column 1 must be 135 - 41 = 94. To keep the sum of all numbers in the grid as low as possible, we should use the two smallest unique integers from the given range that add up to 94. These are 31 and 63. We can put 31 in row 0 and 63 in row 1.

Next, we know that the sum of row 1 must be 134 and we already have 63 in that row. So, the sum of the two 'x's in row 1 must be 134 - 63 = 71. To keep the sum of all numbers in the grid as low as possible, we should use the two smallest unique integers from the given range that add up to 71 and are not already in the grid. These are 32 and 39. We can put 32 in column 0 and 39 in column 2.

Finally, we know that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 122 and we already have 39 in that diagonal. So, the sum of the two 'x's in the diagonal must be 122 - 39 = 83. To keep the sum of all numbers in the grid as low as possible, we should use the two smallest unique integers from the given range that add up to 83 and are not already in the grid. These are 33 and 50. We can put 33 in row 0, column 2 and 50 in row 2, column 0.

So, the final grid is:
 [[31 63 33]
 [32 'x' 39]
 [50 41 'x']]

The remaining 'x's can be replaced with the next smallest unique integers from the given range, which are 34 and 35. We can put 34 in row 1, column 1 and 35 in row 2, column 2.

So, the final grid is:
 [[31 63 33]
 [32 34 39]
 [50 41 35]]

The solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 31 to 75 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start with the first column. The sum of the first column should be 138. Since we already have 55 in the third row, we need to find two numbers that sum to 83 (138 - 55) and are within the range 31 to 75. The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 31 and 52. We can put 31 in the first row and 52 in the second row.

Next, let's look at the first row. The sum of the first row should be 171. Since we already have 31 in the first column, we need to find two numbers that sum to 140 (171 - 31) and are within the range 31 to 75. The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 108. However, 108 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 33 and find two numbers that sum to 138 (171 - 33). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 106. However, 106 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 34 and find two numbers that sum to 137 (171 - 34). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 105. However, 105 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 35 and find two numbers that sum to 136 (171 - 35). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 104. However, 104 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 36 and find two numbers that sum to 135 (171 - 36). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 103. However, 103 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 37 and find two numbers that sum to 134 (171 - 37). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 102. However, 102 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 38 and find two numbers that sum to 133 (171 - 38). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 101. However, 101 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 39 and find two numbers that sum to 132 (171 - 39). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 100. However, 100 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 40 and find two numbers that sum to 131 (171 - 40). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 99. However, 99 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 41 and find two numbers that sum to 130 (171 - 41). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 98. However, 98 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 42 and find two numbers that sum to 129 (171 - 42). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 97. However, 97 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 43 and find two numbers that sum to 128 (171 - 43). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 96. However, 96 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 44 and find two numbers that sum to 127 (171 - 44). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 95. However, 95 is not within the range 31 to 75. Therefore, we need to increase the number in the first column to 45 and find two numbers that sum to 126 (171 - 45). The two smallest numbers that meet this criteria are 32 and 94.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the known numbers in each row, column, and diagonal. 

In column 1, we have only one known number, 40. So, the sum of the known numbers in column 1 is 40. 

In row 1, we have no known numbers. So, the sum of the known numbers in row 1 is 0. 

In the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we have two known numbers, 40 and 71. So, the sum of the known numbers in this diagonal is 111. 

Next, let's find the sum of the unknown numbers in each row, column, and diagonal. 

In column 1, the sum of the unknown numbers is 183 - 40 = 143. 

In row 1, the sum of the unknown numbers is 194 - 0 = 194. 

In the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum of the unknown numbers is 161 - 111 = 50. 

Now, let's find the unique integers that satisfy these conditions. 

In column 1, we need two numbers that sum to 143. The smallest two numbers that satisfy this condition are 71 and 72. 

In row 1, we need three numbers that sum to 194. The smallest three numbers that satisfy this condition are 40, 71, and 83. 

In the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we need one number that is 50. The smallest number that satisfies this condition is 50. 

Finally, let's replace the 'x's in the grid with these numbers. 

In the first row, replace the 'x's with 40, 71, and 83. 

In the second column, replace the 'x's with 71 and 72. 

In the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, replace the 'x' with 50. 

The final grid is: 
 [['40' '71' '83']
 ['71' '72' '50']
 ['40' 'x' '71']]

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 40), (0, 1, 71), (0, 2, 83), (1, 0, 71), (1, 1, 72), (1, 2, 50), (2, 1, 50)].

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the known numbers in each row, column, and diagonal. 

In row 1, the sum of the known numbers is 80 + 48 = 128. 

In column 1, the only known number is 48. 

In the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the only known number is 48. 

Now, let's find the remaining sums that we need to reach for each row, column, and diagonal. 

For row 1, we need to find a number that, when added to 128, equals 186. This number is 186 - 128 = 58. 

For column 1, we need to find two numbers that, when added to 48, equal 153. Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers in the given range that satisfy this condition. These numbers are 40 and 65, because 40 + 65 + 48 = 153. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we need to find two numbers that, when added to 48, equal 188. Since we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers in the given range that satisfy this condition. These numbers are 40 and 100, because 40 + 100 + 48 = 188. 

However, we have a problem: the number 100 is not in the given range. Therefore, we need to choose the next smallest number in the given range that, when added to 40 and 48, equals 188. This number is 89, because 40 + 89 + 48 = 177, which is the closest we can get to 188 with the numbers in the given range. 

Therefore, the final grid is:

 [['40' '65' '89']
 ['80' '48' '58']
 ['40' '40' '40']]

And the solution is:

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that satisfy the given conditions. 

First, let's find the sum of the given numbers in the grid. We have only two numbers: 69 and 71. Their sum is 140.

The sum of all numbers in a 3x3 grid with unique integers ranging from 40 to 89 is the sum of all integers from 40 to 89. This sum is 3245.

The sum of all numbers in the grid should be as low as possible, so we need to use the smallest numbers possible. The smallest numbers that we can use are the ones that are not already in the grid and are not less than 40. These numbers are 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, and 89.

The sum of the smallest seven of these numbers (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46) is 301. 

The sum of all numbers in the grid is the sum of the given numbers and the sum of the smallest seven numbers, which is 140 + 301 = 441.

The sum of all numbers in the grid is less than the sum of all integers from 40 to 89, so we can use the smallest seven numbers.

Now, let's assign these numbers to the 'x's in the grid.

The sum of column 1 must be 198. The number in this column that is already given is 71. So, the sum of the two 'x's in this column is 198 - 71 = 127. The two smallest numbers that add up to 127 are 40 and 87.

The sum of row 1 must be 152. The number in this row that is already given is 87. So, the sum of the two 'x's in this row is 152 - 87 = 65. The two smallest numbers that add up to 65 are 41 and 44.

The sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 195. The number in this diagonal that is already given is 69. So, the sum of the two 'x's in this diagonal is 195 - 69 = 126. The two smallest numbers that add up to 126 are 42 and 84.

The remaining numbers are 43, 45, and 46. We can assign these numbers to the remaining 'x's in the grid.

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 40), (0, 1, 41), (0, 2, 42), (1, 0, 43), (1, 1, 44), (1, 2, 87), (2, 0, 69), (2, 1, 71), (2, 2, 45)].

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that replace the 'x's in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's denote the unknowns in the grid as follows:

 [['48' 'a' 'b']
 ['c' 'd' 'e']
 ['f' '49' 'g']]

From the problem, we know that:

1. The sum of column 1 is 150, so a + d + 49 = 150.
2. The sum of row 1 is 209, so 48 + a + b = 209.
3. The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is 169, so b + d + f = 169.

From these equations, we can solve for a, b, d, and f:

1. a = 150 - d - 49
2. b = 209 - 48 - a
3. f = 169 - b - d

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2 gives b = 209 - 48 - (150 - d - 49) = d + 38. Substituting this into equation 3 gives f = 169 - (d + 38) - d = 131 - 2d.

Now, we need to find the values of c, e, and g. Since we want the sum of all the numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest possible unique integers for these positions. The smallest integers in the range 40 to 89 that are not already in the grid are 40, 41, and 42. We assign these to c, e, and g in that order.

Finally, we substitute the values of a, b, d, and f back into the grid and get the final grid:

 [['48' '51' '110']
 ['40' '51' '41']
 ['80' '49' '42']]

So, the solution is [(0, 1, 51), (0, 2, 110), (1, 0, 40), (1, 1, 51), (1, 2, 41), (2, 0, 80), (2, 2, 42)].

To solve this problem, we need to find the unique integers that replace the 'x' in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's calculate the missing values in the second column. The sum of the second column is 227, and we already have 56, 52 in the column. So, the sum of the missing values is 227 - 56 - 52 = 119. Since we want the sum of all numbers to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest available numbers for the missing values. The smallest available numbers are 41 and 42, but 41 + 42 = 83, which is less than 119. The next smallest number is 43, but 41 + 43 = 84, which is still less than 119. So, we continue this process until we find that 44 + 75 = 119. So, the missing values in the second column are 44 and 75.

Next, let's calculate the missing values in the third column. The sum of the third column is 215, and we already have 44, 62 in the column. So, the sum of the missing values is 215 - 44 - 62 = 109. Again, we want the sum of all numbers to be as low as possible, so we should choose the smallest available numbers for the missing values. The smallest available numbers are 41, 42, 43, and 45, but 41 + 45 = 86, which is less than 109. The next smallest number is 46, but 41 + 46 = 87, which is still less than 109. So, we continue this process until we find that 46 + 63 = 109. So, the missing values in the third column are 46 and 63.

Finally, let's calculate the missing values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of the diagonal is 195, and we already have 40, 44, 45 in the diagonal. So, the sum of the missing value is 195 - 40 - 44 - 45 = 66. The smallest available number is 41, but 41 is less than 66. The next smallest number is 42, but 42 is still less than 66. So, we continue this process until we find that 66 = 66. So, the missing value in the diagonal is 66.

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 44), (0, 2, 46), (1, 0, 75), (1, 1, 63), (2, 0, 66), (2, 2, 57), (3, 0, 41), (3, 1, 42)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 24 to 50 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 174. We already have 35, 46, and 49 in this column. So, the missing number in the first row of the second column should be 174 - 35 - 46 - 49 = 44.

For the second row, the sum should be 158. We already have 43, 41, and 30 in this row. So, the missing number in the second row of the second column should be 158 - 43 - 41 - 30 = 44.

For the third row, the sum should be 131. We already have 46 and 33 in this row. So, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 46 - 33 = 52. But 52 is not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row. Let's replace 46 with 45 and 33 with 32. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 45 - 32 = 54. But 54 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 45 with 44 and 32 with 31. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 44 - 31 = 56. But 56 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 44 with 43 and 31 with 30. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 43 - 30 = 58. But 58 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 43 with 42 and 30 with 29. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 42 - 29 = 60. But 60 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 42 with 41 and 29 with 28. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 41 - 28 = 62. But 62 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 41 with 40 and 28 with 27. Then, the missing number in the third row of the first column should be 131 - 40 - 27 = 64. But 64 is still not in the range of 24 to 50. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third row again. Let's replace 40 with 39 and 27 with 26.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 24 to 50 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

[['38' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '39' '40' '27']
 ['32' '46' 'x' '25']]

We know that the sum of the second column is 149, and we already have 39 and 46 in that column. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers in that column is 149 - 39 - 46 = 64. Since we want to minimize the sum of all numbers in the grid, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the range 24 to 50 that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 24 and 40. However, 40 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, which is 41. So, the two numbers in the second column are 24 and 41.

Similarly, we know that the sum of the third column is 178, and we already have 40 in that column. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers in that column is 178 - 40 = 138. Again, we should choose the smallest three numbers from the range 24 to 50 that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 26, 28, and 29.

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 151, and we already have 38 and 25 in that diagonal. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers in that diagonal is 151 - 38 - 25 = 88. Again, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the range 24 to 50 that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 30 and 31.

So, the final grid is:

[['38' '24' '26' 'x']
 ['41' 'x' '28' 'x']
 ['x' '39' '40' '27']
 ['32' '46' '29' '25']]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 24 to 50 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 135. We already have 31 in the second row, so we need to find three other numbers that add up to 104. The smallest three numbers in our range that add up to 104 are 24, 25, and 55. We can put 24 in the first row, 25 in the third row, and 55 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum should be 160. We already have 40 in the first row, so we need to find three other numbers that add up to 120. The smallest three numbers in our range that are not already used and add up to 120 are 26, 27, and 67. We can put 26 in the second row, 27 in the third row, and 67 in the fourth row. 

For the second row, the sum should be 125. We already have 31 and 43 in the second row, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 51. The smallest two numbers in our range that are not already used and add up to 51 are 24 and 27. We can put 24 in the first column and 27 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the sum should be 164. We already have 37 and 32 in the third row, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 95. The smallest two numbers in our range that are not already used and add up to 95 are 26 and 69. We can put 26 in the second column and 69 in the fourth column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 146. We already have 43 and 37 in the diagonal, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 66. The smallest two numbers in our range that are not already used and add up to 66 are 24 and 42. We can put 24 in the first row and 42 in the fourth row. 

So, the final grid is:
 [['24' '24' '40' '24']
 ['24' '31' '26' '43']
 ['37' '25' '27' '32']
 ['34' '29' '67' '42']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:
[(0, 0, 24), (0, 1, 24), (0, 3, 24), (1, 0, 24), (1, 2, 26), (2, 1, 25), (2, 2, 27), (2, 3, 69), (3, 2, 67), (3, 3, 42)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 24 to 50 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum is 141. We already have 42, 38, 36, and 25 in this column. So, the sum of these numbers is 141. Therefore, we don't need to add any numbers in this column.

For the third column, the sum is 134. We already have 'x', 'x', 46, and 24 in this column. So, the sum of these numbers is 70. Therefore, we need to add 64 to this column. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we should add the smallest possible numbers. The smallest numbers available are 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. We already used 24, 25, 36, 42, 46, and 49. So, the smallest numbers available are 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, and 50. We can use 26 and 38 to add up to 64. So, we fill in the 'x' in the first and second rows of the third column with 26 and 38 respectively.

For the second row, the sum is 133. We already have 'x', 38, 26, and 'x' in this row. So, the sum of these numbers is 64. Therefore, we need to add 69 to this row. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we should add the smallest possible numbers. The smallest numbers available are 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, and 50. We can use 27 and 42 to add up to 69. So, we fill in the 'x' in the first and fourth columns of the second row with 27 and 42 respectively.

For the third row, the sum is 150. We already have 'x', 36, 46, and 'x' in this row. So, the sum of these numbers is 82. Therefore, we need to add 68 to this row. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we should add the smallest possible numbers. The smallest numbers available are 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, and 50. We can use 28 and 40 to add up to 68. So, we fill in the 'x' in the first and fourth columns of the third row with 28 and 40 respectively.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum is 155. We already have 'x', 38, 46, and 49 in this diagonal. So, the sum of these numbers is 133. Therefore, we need to add 22 to this diagonal. Since we want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, we should add the smallest possible number. The smallest number available is 29. So, we fill in the 'x' in the first row and fourth column with 29.

So, the final grid is:
 [[29, 42, 26, 29]
 [27, 38, 38, 42]
 [28, 36, 46, 40]
 [49, 25, 24, 29]]

And the list of tuples is:

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 212. We already have 51 in the first row, so we need to find three numbers that add up to 212 - 51 = 161. The smallest three numbers that add up to 161 are 35, 36, and 90. We can put 35 in the second row, 36 in the third row, and 90 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum should be 185. We already have 39 and 48 in the first and second rows, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 185 - 39 - 48 = 98. The smallest two numbers that add up to 98 are 37 and 61. We can put 37 in the third row and 61 in the fourth row. 

For the second row, the sum should be 180. We already have 48 and 37 in the second and fourth columns, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 180 - 48 - 37 = 95. The smallest two numbers that add up to 95 are 38 and 57. We can put 38 in the first column and 57 in the third column. 

For the third row, the sum should be 202. We already have 54 in the first column, so we need to find three numbers that add up to 202 - 54 = 148. The smallest three numbers that add up to 148 are 39, 40, and 69. We can put 39 in the second column, 40 in the third column, and 69 in the fourth column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum should be 193. We already have 53 in the bottom right corner, so we need to find three numbers that add up to 193 - 53 = 140. The smallest three numbers that add up to 140 are 41, 42, and 57. We can put 41 in the third row, second column, 42 in the second row, first column, and 57 in the first row, fourth column.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 35 to 61 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the minimum possible values from the given range (35 to 61) that are not already in the grid and do not violate the constraints. 

We start with the first row. The third column is already filled with 39, so we fill the first, second and fourth columns with the smallest available numbers, 35, 36 and 37 respectively. 

Next, we move to the second row. The fourth column is already filled with 43, so we fill the first, second and third columns with the next smallest available numbers, 38, 40 and 41 respectively. 

For the third row, the fourth column is already filled with 47, so we fill the first, second and third columns with the next smallest available numbers, 42, 44 and 45 respectively. 

Finally, for the fourth row, the first, second and fourth columns are already filled, so we fill the third column with the next smallest available number, 48. 

Now, we check if the sums of the columns, rows and diagonal match the given constraints. 

The sum of the second column is 35 + 38 + 42 + 49 = 164, which is less than the required sum of 188. So, we need to increase some numbers in this column. 

The sum of the third column is 36 + 40 + 44 + 48 = 168, which is also less than the required sum of 188. So, we need to increase some numbers in this column as well. 

The sum of the second row is 38 + 40 + 41 + 43 = 162, which is less than the required sum of 177. So, we need to increase some numbers in this row. 

The sum of the third row is 42 + 44 + 45 + 47 = 178, which is more than the required sum of 160. So, we need to decrease some numbers in this row. 

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner is 37 + 41 + 44 + 46 = 168, which is less than the required sum of 173. So, we need to increase some numbers in this diagonal. 

After adjusting the numbers to meet the constraints, the final grid is:

 [['35' '36' '39' '37']
 ['38' '56' '40' '43']
 ['42' '44' '31' '47']
 ['46' '49' '48' '53']]

So, the solution is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 35 to 61 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the grid with the given numbers and 'x' for the unknowns:

[['x' '50' 'x' 'x']
 ['58' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '49' 'x' '59']
 ['39' '41' 'x' 'x']]

Next, we can calculate the missing numbers in the rows and columns with known sums. 

For the second column, the sum is 177. We already have 50 and 49 in this column, so the sum of the missing numbers is 177 - 50 - 49 = 78. The smallest two numbers that are not already in the grid and add up to 78 are 35 and 43. We can put 35 in the second row and 43 in the fourth row.

For the third column, the sum is 196. We already have 59 in this column, so the sum of the missing numbers is 196 - 59 = 137. The smallest two numbers that are not already in the grid and add up to 137 are 61 and 76. We can put 61 in the second row and 76 in the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum is 183. We already have 58, 35, and 61 in this row, so the missing number is 183 - 58 - 35 - 61 = 29. We can put 29 in the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum is 190. We already have 49 and 59 in this row, so the missing number is 190 - 49 - 59 = 82. We can put 82 in the first column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 188. We already have 59 and 41 in this diagonal, so the missing number is 188 - 59 - 41 = 88. We can put 88 in the first column of the first row.

The final grid is:

[['88' '50' 'x' 'x']
 ['58' '35' '61' '29']
 ['82' '49' 'x' '59']
 ['39' '43' '76' 'x']]

The solution as a list of tuples is:

[(0, 0, 88), (1, 1, 35), (1, 2, 61), (1, 3, 29), (2, 0, 82), (3, 1, 43), (3, 2, 76)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 35 to 61 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

 [['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '37' 'x' '41']
 ['48' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['49' 'x' '46' '38']]

We know that the sum of the second row is 180, so the missing values in the second row are 180 - 37 - 41 = 102. We also know that the sum of the third row is 176, so the missing values in the third row are 176 - 48 = 128. 

Next, we know that the sum of the second column is 151, so the missing values in the second column are 151 - 37 = 114. We also know that the sum of the third column is 189, so the missing values in the third column are 189 - 41 = 148. 

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 184, so the missing values in the diagonal are 184 - 41 - 46 = 97. 

Now, we need to distribute these missing values among the 'x' positions in the grid. We want to use the smallest possible unique integers to keep the total sum of the grid as low as possible. 

Let's start with the second row. We can fill in the 'x' positions with the smallest possible unique integers that add up to 102. The smallest possible unique integers that add up to 102 are 35 and 67. 

Next, let's fill in the third row. We can fill in the 'x' positions with the smallest possible unique integers that add up to 128. The smallest possible unique integers that add up to 128 are 36, 39, and 53. 

Then, let's fill in the second column. We can fill in the 'x' positions with the smallest possible unique integers that add up to 114. The smallest possible unique integers that add up to 114 are 38 and 76. 

After that, let's fill in the third column. We can fill in the 'x' positions with the smallest possible unique integers that add up to 148. The smallest possible unique integers that add up to 148 are 40, 42, and 66. 

Finally, let's fill in the diagonal. We can fill in the 'x' positions with the smallest possible unique integers that add up to 97. The smallest possible unique integers that add up to 97 are 37 and 60. 

So, the final grid is:

 [['35' '38' '40' '37']
 ['36' '37' '42' '41']
 ['48' '39' '53' '36']
 ['49' '76' '46' '38']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

[(0, 0, 35), (0, 1, 38), (0, 2, 40), (0, 3, 37), (1, 0, 36), (1, 2, 42), (2, 1, 39), (2, 2, 53), (2, 3, 36), (3, 1, 76)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 34 to 60 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the second column which has a sum constraint of 198. We already have 46 in the first row and 44 in the second row. So, the sum of the numbers in the third and fourth rows should be 198 - 46 - 44 = 108. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 34 to 60 which are not already in the grid. These are 34 and 35. We can put 34 in the third row and 35 in the fourth row.

Next, let's fill in the third column which has a sum constraint of 175. We don't have any numbers in this column yet. So, we can choose the smallest four numbers from the range 34 to 60 which are not already in the grid. These are 36, 37, 38, and 39. However, 38 and 39 are already in the grid. So, we choose the next smallest numbers which are 40 and 41. We can put 36 in the first row, 37 in the second row, 40 in the third row, and 41 in the fourth row.

Now, let's fill in the second row which has a sum constraint of 201. We already have 44 in the first column and 37 in the third column. So, the sum of the numbers in the second and fourth columns should be 201 - 44 - 37 = 120. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 34 to 60 which are not already in the grid. These are 42 and 43. We can put 42 in the second column and 43 in the fourth column.

Next, let's fill in the third row which has a sum constraint of 190. We already have 39 in the first column, 34 in the second column, and 40 in the third column. So, the number in the fourth column should be 190 - 39 - 34 - 40 = 77. However, 77 is not in the range 34 to 60. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the second and third columns. We can increase the number in the second column to 35 and the number in the third column to 41. Then, the number in the fourth column can be 73 which is in the range.

Finally, let's fill in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner which has a sum constraint of 193. We already have 46 in the top right corner and 38 in the bottom left corner. So, the sum of the numbers in the second and third positions should be 193 - 46 - 38 = 109. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 34 to 60 which are not already in the grid. These are 44 and 45. We can put 44 in the second position and 45 in the third position.

So, the final grid is:
 [[36, 46, 41, 44]
 [44, 42, 37, 43]

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second row, we have the numbers 46 and 41 already filled in. The sum of the row should be 179. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 179 - 46 - 41 = 92. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 34 to 60 that are not already in the grid and add up to 92. These numbers are 34 and 58. We can fill in these numbers in the first and third positions of the second row.

For the third row, we have the numbers 57 and 55 already filled in. The sum of the row should be 190. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 190 - 57 - 55 = 78. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 34 to 60 that are not already in the grid and add up to 78. These numbers are 35 and 43. We can fill in these numbers in the first and fourth positions of the third row.

For the second column, we have the numbers 46, 57, and 37 already filled in. The sum of the column should be 179. So, the remaining number should be 179 - 46 - 57 - 37 = 39. We can fill in this number in the first position of the second column.

For the third column, we have the numbers 55 already filled in. The sum of the column should be 194. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 194 - 55 = 139. We can choose the smallest three numbers from the range 34 to 60 that are not already in the grid and add up to 139. These numbers are 36, 50, and 53. We can fill in these numbers in the first, second, and fourth positions of the third column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we have the numbers 41 and 55 already filled in. The sum of the diagonal should be 205.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 34 to 60 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 165. We already have 50 in this column, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 115 (165 - 50). The smallest two numbers that add up to 115 are 57 and 58. We can put 57 in the second row and 58 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum should be 155. We don't have any numbers in this column yet, so we need to find three numbers that add up to 155. The smallest three numbers that add up to 155 are 51, 52, and 53. We can put 51 in the first row, 52 in the second row, and 53 in the third row. 

For the second row, the sum should be 169. We already have 52 and 51 in this row, so we need to find a number that adds up to 66 (169 - 52 - 51). The smallest number that is 66 is 66. We can put 66 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the sum should be 190. We already have 50 and 53 in this row, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 87 (190 - 50 - 53). The smallest two numbers that add up to 87 are 43 and 44. We can put 43 in the first row and 44 in the fourth row. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 201. We already have 56 and 46 in this diagonal, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 99 (201 - 56 - 46). The smallest two numbers that add up to 99 are 49 and 50. We can put 49 in the second row and 50 in the third row. 

Now, we need to fill in the remaining 'x's in the grid. We can use the smallest remaining numbers to keep the sum of all the numbers in the grid as low as possible. The smallest remaining numbers are 34, 35, 36, and 37. We can put 34 in the first row, 35 in the second row, 36 in the third row, and 37 in the fourth row. 

So, the final grid is:
 [['37' '51' '34' '56']

 ['58' '36' '35' '46']]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 9 to 40 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second row, the sum should be 114 and we already have 28. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 114 - 28 = 86. We can fill in the smallest three unique numbers from the range 9 to 40 that add up to 86. These numbers are 27, 29, and 30. We can put 27 in the second column, 29 in the third column, and 30 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the sum should be 84 and we already have 11 and 33. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 84 - 11 - 33 = 40. We can fill in the smallest two unique numbers from the range 9 to 40 that add up to 40. These numbers are 19 and 21. We can put 19 in the first column and 21 in the fourth column. 

For the second column, the sum should be 77 and we already have 27 and 20. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 77 - 27 - 20 = 30. We can fill in the smallest two unique numbers from the range 9 to 40 that add up to 30. These numbers are 14 and 16. We can put 14 in the first row and 16 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum should be 110 and we already have 29, 33, and 38. So, the remaining number should be 110 - 29 - 33 - 38 = 10. We can put 10 in the first row. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 98 and we already have 39 and 21. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 98 - 39 - 21 = 38. We can fill in the smallest two unique numbers from the range 9 to 40 that add up to 38. These numbers are 17 and 21. We can put 17 in the second row and 21 in the third row.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 9 to 40 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows that have specified sums. 

For the second column, the sum should be 102. We already have 21 in the second row and 16 in the third row, so the sum of the numbers in the first and fourth rows should be 102 - 21 - 16 = 65. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 10 and 12, in the first and fourth rows respectively. 

For the third column, the sum should be 100. We already have 27 in the first row and 31 in the third row, so the sum of the numbers in the second and fourth rows should be 100 - 27 - 31 = 42. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 13 and 14, in the second and fourth rows respectively. 

For the second row, the sum should be 72. We already have 21 in the first column and 15 in the fourth column, so the sum of the numbers in the second and third columns should be 72 - 21 - 15 = 36. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 17 and 18, in the second and third columns respectively. 

For the third row, the sum should be 97. We already have 16 in the second column and 31 in the third column, so the sum of the numbers in the first and fourth columns should be 97 - 16 - 31 = 50. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 19 and 20, in the first and fourth columns respectively. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 46. We already have 9 in the first row and 32 in the fourth row, so the sum of the numbers in the second and third rows should be 46 - 9 - 32 = 5. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 22 and 23, in the second and third rows respectively. 

Finally, we can fill in the remaining 'x's with the smallest available numbers, 24 and 25, in the first and fourth rows respectively. 

So, the final grid is:
 [[10, 24, 27, 9]
 [21, 17, 18, 15]
 [19, 16, 31, 23]
 [11, 12, 14, 20]]

The solution as a list of tuples is: [(0, 0, 10), (0, 1, 24), (1, 1, 17), (1, 2, 18), (2, 0, 19), (2, 3, 23), (3, 1, 12), (3, 3, 20)].

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 121. We already have 35 and 31 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 121 - 35 - 31 = 55. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 9 and 46, in the second column. 

For the third column, the sum should be 107. We already have 27 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 107 - 27 = 80. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 10 and 70, in the third column. 

For the second row, the sum should be 89. We already have 18 in this row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 89 - 18 = 71. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 11 and 60, in the second row. 

For the third row, the sum should be 103. We already have 21 in this row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 103 - 21 = 82. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 12 and 70, in the third row. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum should be 102. We already have 14 and 19 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 102 - 14 - 19 = 69. We can fill in the smallest available numbers, 13 and 56, in this diagonal. 

After filling in all the numbers, the grid looks like this:

 [['14' '35' '10' '9']
 ['11' '12' '13' '18']
 ['12' '31' '27' '21']
 ['30' '9' '10' '19']]

So, the solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 9 to 40 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the grid with the given numbers and 'x' for the unknowns:

[['x' 'x' '22' '23']
 ['x' 'x' '15' '25']
 ['31' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['12' '36' 'x' '13']]

Next, we need to calculate the missing numbers in the columns and rows with specified sums. 

For the second column, the sum is 116. The known numbers in this column are 36. So, the sum of the unknown numbers is 116 - 36 = 80. 

For the third row, the sum is 111. The known numbers in this row are 31. So, the sum of the unknown numbers is 111 - 31 = 80. 

Since the sum of the unknown numbers in the second column and the third row is the same, we can conclude that the unknown number at the intersection of the second column and the third row is the smallest possible number, which is 9. 

For the third column, the sum is 78. The known numbers in this column are 22 and 15. So, the sum of the unknown numbers is 78 - 22 - 15 = 41. 

Since we have already filled in one of the unknown numbers in the third column with 9, the remaining unknown number in this column is 41 - 9 = 32. 

For the second row, the sum is 94. The known numbers in this row are 15 and 25. So, the sum of the unknown numbers is 94 - 15 - 25 = 54. 

Since we have already filled in one of the unknown numbers in the second row with 32, the remaining unknown number in this row is 54 - 32 = 22. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum is 70. The known numbers in this diagonal are 23 and 13. So, the sum of the unknown numbers is 70 - 23 - 13 = 34. 

Since we have already filled in one of the unknown numbers in this diagonal with 22, the remaining unknown number in this diagonal is 34 - 22 = 12. 

So, the final grid is:

[['x' '22' '22' '23']
 ['32' '22' '15' '25']
 ['31' '9' 'x' 'x']
 ['12' '36' '32' '13']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 28 to 59 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the sum is 208. We already have 56 in the second row, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 152 (208 - 56) and are unique and within the range. The smallest such numbers are 28 and 124. We can put 28 in the first row and 124 in the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum is 196. We already have 41 and 56 in the first and second columns, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 99 (196 - 41 - 56) and are unique and within the range. The smallest such numbers are 29 and 70. We can put 29 in the third column and 70 in the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum is 162. We already have 29 and 55 in the third and fourth columns, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 78 (162 - 29 - 55) and are unique and within the range. The smallest such numbers are 30 and 48. We can put 30 in the first column and 48 in the second column.

For the third column, the sum is 157. We already have 29 and 42 in the third and fourth rows, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 86 (157 - 29 - 42) and are unique and within the range. The smallest such numbers are 31 and 55. We can put 31 in the first row and 55 in the second row.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 166. We already have 37 and 42 in the first and fourth rows, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 87 (166 - 37 - 42) and are unique and within the range. The smallest such numbers are 32 and 55. We can put 32 in the second row and 55 in the third row.

So, the final grid is:
 [['30' '28' '31' '37']
 ['41' '56' '29' '70']
 ['30' '48' '29' '55']

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 28 to 59 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the second column and second row, since we have the sum constraints for them. The sum of the second column is 162, and we already have 53 in it, so the remaining numbers should sum up to 162 - 53 = 109. The sum of the second row is 168, and we already have 54 in it, so the remaining numbers should sum up to 168 - 54 = 114. 

We can fill in the second column with the smallest available numbers to keep the total sum as low as possible. The smallest available numbers are 29, 30, and 50. These numbers sum up to 109, so we can put 29 in the first row, 30 in the second row, and 50 in the third row of the second column. 

Now, we need to fill in the second row. We already have 30 and 54 in it, so the remaining numbers should sum up to 114 - 30 - 54 = 30. The smallest available numbers that sum up to 30 are 31 and 32, so we can put 31 in the first column and 32 in the fourth column of the second row. 

Next, we need to fill in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left. The sum of the diagonal is 168, and we already have 46 and 32 in it, so the remaining numbers should sum up to 168 - 46 - 32 = 90. The smallest available numbers that sum up to 90 are 33 and 57, so we can put 33 in the third row and 57 in the fourth row of the diagonal. 

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining 'x's in the grid. We can use the smallest available numbers to keep the total sum as low as possible. The smallest available numbers are 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 55, 56, and 58. We can put these numbers in the remaining 'x's in the grid in ascending order.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the second column and second row, as we have the sum constraints for them. The sum of the second column is 134 and we already have 44 in it. So, the sum of the remaining two 'x' values should be 134 - 44 = 90. As we want the sum of all numbers to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the range 28 to 59 that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 28 and 29. We can put 28 in the second row and 29 in the fourth row.

Next, let's fill in the values for the third column. The sum of the third column is 166 and we already have 49 in it. So, the sum of the remaining two 'x' values should be 166 - 49 = 117. Again, we should choose the smallest two numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 31 and 32. We can put 31 in the first row and 32 in the fourth row.

Now, let's fill in the values for the second row. The sum of the second row is 185 and we already have 44, 28 and 31 in it. So, the remaining 'x' value should be 185 - 44 - 28 - 31 = 82. 

Finally, let's fill in the values for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner. The sum of the diagonal is 173 and we already have 42, 44 and 30 in it. So, the remaining 'x' value should be 173 - 42 - 44 - 30 = 57. 

So, the final grid is:
 [['50' '31' 'x' '42']
 ['28' 'x' '44' '82']
 ['47' '29' '49' 'x']
 ['53' 'x' '32' '30']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is: [(0, 1, 31), (1, 0, 28), (1, 3, 82), (2, 1, 29), (3, 1, 57), (3, 2, 32), (0, 2, 57), (2, 3, 57)].

First, let's fill in the values for the second column, which should sum up to 170. We already have 48 and 39 in the column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 170 - 48 - 39 = 83. We need to choose two numbers from the range 28 to 59 that add up to 83 and are as small as possible. The smallest pair of numbers that add up to 83 are 41 and 42. Since 42 is already in the grid, we choose 41 and 43. We put 41 in the first row and 43 in the fourth row.

Next, let's fill in the values for the third row, which should sum up to 157. We already have 39 and 30 in the row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 157 - 39 - 30 = 88. We need to choose two numbers from the range 28 to 59 that add up to 88 and are as small as possible. The smallest pair of numbers that add up to 88 are 43 and 45.

Next, let's fill in the values for the second row, which should sum up to 191. We already have 48 in the row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 191 - 48 = 143. We need to choose three numbers from the range 28 to 59 that add up to 143 and are as small as possible. The smallest trio of numbers that add up to 143 are 45, 48, and 50. Since 45 and 48 are already in the grid, we choose 46, 47, and 50. We put 46 in the first column, 47 in the third column, and 50 in the fourth column.

Finally, let's fill in the values for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, which should sum up to 171.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 22 to 53 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, we know that the sum must be 141 and we already have 34 and 37 in the row. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers must be 141 - 34 - 37 = 70. We can choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid and that add up to 70. These numbers are 22 and 48. We can put 22 in the third column because we know that the sum of the third column must be 162 and we already have 22 in the fourth row. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers must be 162 - 22 = 140. If we put 48 in the third column, the sum of the remaining two numbers would have to be 140 - 48 = 92, which is not possible with the numbers we have left. So, we put 22 in the third column and 48 in the fourth column.

For the third row, we know that the sum must be 135 and we already have 43 and 22 in the row. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers must be 135 - 43 - 22 = 70. We can choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid and that add up to 70. These numbers are 23 and 47. We can put 23 in the first column because we don't have any constraints on the sum of the first column. We put 47 in the third column.

For the second column, we know that the sum must be 137 and we already have 37 and 43 in the column. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers must be 137 - 37 - 43 = 57. We can choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid and that add up to 57. These numbers are 24 and 33. We can put 24 in the first row and 33 in the fourth row.

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we know that the sum must be 151 and we already have 40 and 47 in the diagonal. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers must be 151 - 40 - 47 = 64. We can choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid and that add up to 64. These numbers are 25 and 39. We can put 25 in the second column of the first row and 39 in the third column of the fourth row.

Finally, we fill in the remaining 'x's with the smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 26, 27, 28, and 29. We can put 26 in the first column of the first row, 27 in the fourth column of the first row, 28 in the first column of the fourth row, and 29 in the second column of the fourth row.

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 26), (0, 1, 25), (0, 2, 24), (0, 3, 27), (1, 2, 22), (1, 3, 48), (2, 0, 23), (2, 2, 47), (3, 0, 28), (3, 1, 29), (3, 2, 39), (3, 3, 33)].

For the second column, we know that the sum is 148 and we already have 32 in the grid. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 148 - 32 = 116. We have already chosen 24 for the second row, so the remaining two numbers should add up to 116 - 24 = 92. Let's choose 30 and 62. 

For the third column, we know that the sum is 157 and we already have 51, 31, and 52 in the grid. So, the remaining number should be 157 - 51 - 31 - 52 = 23. 

Now, let's fill in the numbers for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner. We know that the sum is 133 and we already have 51 and 52 in the grid. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 133 - 51 - 52 = 30. We have already chosen 23 for the third column, so the remaining number should be 30 - 23 = 7. 

Finally, let's fill in the remaining numbers in the grid. We need to choose numbers that are as low as possible and have not been used yet. Let's choose 25, 26, 27, and 28. 

So, the final grid is:
 [['35' '30' '51' '25']
 ['22' '24' '69' '23']
 ['26' '32' '31' '52']
 ['27' '62' '23' '28']]

And the solution is:
[(1, 0, 22), (1, 1, 24), (1, 2, 69), (2, 0, 26), (2, 3, 34), (3, 0, 27), (3, 1, 62), (3, 2, 23), (3, 3, 28), (0, 1, 30), (0, 3, 25)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 23 to 54 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

[['45' '53' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['47' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['35' 'x' '52' 'x']]

We know that the sum of the second column is 173, and we already have 53 in that column. So, the sum of the remaining numbers in the second column is 173 - 53 = 120. We also know that the sum of the third row is 165, and we already have 47 in that row. So, the sum of the remaining numbers in the third row is 165 - 47 = 118. 

Since the sum of the remaining numbers in the second column is greater than the sum of the remaining numbers in the third row, we can fill in the intersection of the second column and third row with the smallest possible number, which is 23. 

Now, the grid looks like this:

[['45' '53' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['47' '23' 'x' 'x']
 ['35' 'x' '52' 'x']]

The sum of the remaining numbers in the second column is now 120 - 23 = 97, and the sum of the remaining numbers in the third row is 118 - 23 = 95. 

We can continue this process, filling in the smallest possible number at the intersection of the row and column with the greatest remaining sum, until the grid is filled. 

After filling in all the 'x's, the grid looks like this:

[['45' '53' '24' '25']
 ['23' '24' '25' '26']
 ['47' '23' '24' '25']
 ['35' '26' '52' '24']]

So, the solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position:

[(0, 2, 24), (0, 3, 25), (1, 0, 23), (1, 1, 24), (1, 2, 25), (1, 3, 26), (2, 2, 24), (2, 3, 25), (3, 1, 26), (3, 3, 24)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 23 to 54 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the sum is 135. We already have 31 and 49 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 135 - 31 - 49 = 55. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These are 23 and 24. We can put 23 in the first row and 24 in the third row. 

For the third column, the sum is 149. We already have 42 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 149 - 42 = 107. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the three smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These are 25, 26, and 27. We can put 25 in the first row, 26 in the second row, and 27 in the fourth row. 

For the second row, the sum is 156. We already have 26 in this row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 156 - 26 = 130. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the three smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These are 28, 29, and 30. We can put 28 in the first column, 29 in the third column, and 30 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the sum is also 156. We already have 24, 42, and 27 in this row, so the remaining number should be 156 - 24 - 42 - 27 = 63. We can put 63 in the first column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 149. We already have 31 and 30 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 149 - 31 - 30 = 88. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid. These are 32 and 33. We can put 32 in the second row and 33 in the fourth row. 

The final grid is:
 [[23 '31' '25' 'x']

 ['24' 'x' '42' '27']

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, we already have the numbers 40, 39, 32, and 53. The sum of these numbers is 164, which matches the constraint for the second row. So, we don't need to change anything in the second row.

For the third row, we already have the numbers 46 and 58. The sum of these numbers is 104. The constraint for the third row is 210, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 106 (210 - 104) to replace the 'x' values. We'll choose the smallest two numbers in the range 30 to 66 that aren't already in the grid and sum to 106, which are 30 and 76.

For the second column, we already have the numbers 39 and 30. The sum of these numbers is 69. The constraint for the second column is 199, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 130 (199 - 69) to replace the 'x' values. We'll choose the smallest two numbers in the range 30 to 66 that aren't already in the grid and sum to 130, which are 31 and 99.

For the third column, we already have the numbers 32 and 58. The sum of these numbers is 90. The constraint for the third column is 194, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 104 (194 - 90) to replace the 'x' values. We'll choose the smallest two numbers in the range 30 to 66 that aren't already in the grid and sum to 104, which are 33 and 71.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we already have the numbers 53 and 43. The sum of these numbers is 96. The constraint for the diagonal is 197, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 101 (197 - 96) to replace the 'x' values. We'll choose the smallest two numbers in the range 30 to 66 that aren't already in the grid and sum to 101, which are 34 and 67.

So, the final grid is:

 ['40' '39' '32' '53']
 ['46' '30' '58' '76']
 ['99' '71' '43' '51']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 30 to 66 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second row, we have 44 and 36 already filled in, which sum up to 80. The total sum for this row is 173, so we need to find two numbers that sum up to 173 - 80 = 93. The smallest two numbers that sum up to 93 are 30 and 63. However, 63 is already in the grid, so we need to find the next smallest pair of numbers. The next smallest pair of numbers that sum up to 93 are 31 and 62. So, we fill in the second row with 31 and 62.

For the third column, we have 63 and 38 already filled in, which sum up to 101. The total sum for this column is 208, so we need to find two numbers that sum up to 208 - 101 = 107. The smallest two numbers that sum up to 107 are 32 and 75. However, 75 is not in the range of 30 to 66, so we need to find the next smallest pair of numbers. The next smallest pair of numbers that sum up to 107 are 33 and 74. However, 74 is also not in the range of 30 to 66, so we continue this process until we find a pair of numbers in the range of 30 to 66. The smallest pair of numbers in the range of 30 to 66 that sum up to 107 are 41 and 66. So, we fill in the third column with 41 and 66.

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we have 63 and 64 already filled in, which sum up to 127. The total sum for this diagonal is 201, so we need to find two numbers that sum up to 201 - 127 = 74. The smallest two numbers that sum up to 74 are 33 and 41. However, 41 is already in the grid, so we need to find the next smallest pair of numbers. The next smallest pair of numbers that sum up to 74 are 34 and 40. So, we fill in the diagonal with 34 and 40.

Finally, we fill in the remaining 'x's with the smallest numbers that are not already in the grid. The smallest numbers not already in the grid are 30, 32, 35, and 37. So, we fill in the remaining 'x's with these numbers.

The final grid is:
 [[30 32 63 34]
 [31 44 62 36]
 [50 35 41 60]
 [37 52 38 64]]

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 30), (0, 1, 32), (0, 3, 34), (1, 0, 31), (1, 2, 62), (2, 1, 35), (2, 2, 41), (3, 0, 37)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the columns where the sum is specified. 

For the second column, the sum is 154. We already have 30 and 34 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 154 - 30 - 34 = 90. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 66 that are not already in the grid, sum to 90, and are as small as possible. The smallest such pair of numbers is 45 and 45, but since the numbers must be unique, we choose the next smallest pair, which is 45 and 46. We place the smaller number in the third row, because we want the sum of the numbers in the third row to be as small as possible. So, we replace 'x' in the second column and third row with 45, and 'x' in the second column and fourth row with 46.

For the third column, the sum is 157. We already have 33 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 157 - 33 = 124. We need to choose three numbers from the range 30 to 66 that are not already in the grid, sum to 124, and are as small as possible. The smallest such trio of numbers is 40, 41, and 43. We place the smallest number in the first row, because we want the sum of the numbers in the first row to be as small as possible. So, we replace 'x' in the third column and first row with 40, 'x' in the third column and second row with 41, and 'x' in the third column and third row with 43.

Next, let's fill in the values for the rows where the sum is specified.

For the second row, the sum is 173. We already have 43 and 53 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 173 - 43 - 53 = 77. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 66 that are not already in the grid, sum to 77, and are as small as possible. The smallest such pair of numbers is 38 and 39. So, we replace 'x' in the second row and second column with 38, and 'x' in the second row and third column with 39.

For the third row, the sum is 194. We already have 45 and 37 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 194 - 45 - 37 = 112. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 66 that are not already in the grid, sum to 112, and are as small as possible. The smallest such pair of numbers is 55 and 57. So, we replace 'x' in the third row and first column with 55, and 'x' in the third row and fourth column with 57.

Finally, let's fill in the values for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid, where the sum is 208. We already have 49 and 38 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 208 - 49 - 38 = 121. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 66 that are not already in the grid, sum to 121, and are as small as possible. The smallest such pair of numbers is 60 and 61. So, we replace 'x' in the first column and fourth row with 60, and 'x' in the fourth column and fourth row with 61.

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, we know that the sum should be 192 and we already have the numbers 40 and 52. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 192 - 40 - 52 = 100. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 66 that add up to 100 and are as low as possible. The numbers 45 and 55 fit these criteria. We can put 45 in the second position and 55 in the fourth position. 

For the third row, we know that the sum should be 173 and we already have the number 34. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 173 - 34 = 139. We need to choose three numbers from the range 30 to 66 that add up to 139 and are as low as possible. The numbers 30, 31, and 78 fit these criteria. We can put 30 in the first position, 31 in the second position, and 78 in the fourth position. 

For the second column, we know that the sum should be 191 and we already have the numbers 65, 45, and 31. So, the remaining number should be 191 - 65 - 45 - 31 = 50. We can put 50 in the first position. 

For the third column, we know that the sum should be 190 and we already have the numbers 49, 52, and 34. So, the remaining number should be 190 - 49 - 52 - 34 = 55. We can put 55 in the first position. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we know that the sum should be 180 and we already have the numbers 35, 52, 31, and 61. So, the remaining number should be 180 - 35 - 52 - 31 - 61 = 1. We can put 1 in the first position.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 31 to 67 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the given numbers and 'x' for the unknowns:

[['x' 'x' '64' 'x']
 ['34' '54' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '56' '53' 'x']
 ['36' 'x' 'x' '49']]

Next, we can calculate the missing numbers in the rows and columns with known sums. 

For the second row, the sum is 156 and we already have 34 and 54, so the sum of the missing numbers is 156 - 34 - 54 = 68. We need to choose two numbers that sum to 68 and are as low as possible. The lowest numbers available are 31 and 37, but their sum is 68, so we fill the second row with these numbers:

[['x' 'x' '64' 'x']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['x' '56' '53' 'x']
 ['36' 'x' 'x' '49']]

For the third row, the sum is 208 and we already have 56 and 53, so the sum of the missing numbers is 208 - 56 - 53 = 99. We need to choose two numbers that sum to 99 and are as low as possible. The lowest numbers available are 32 and 67, but their sum is 99, so we fill the third row with these numbers:

[['x' 'x' '64' 'x']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['32' '56' '53' '67']
 ['36' 'x' 'x' '49']]

For the second column, the sum is 217 and we already have 54 and 56, so the sum of the missing numbers is 217 - 54 - 56 = 107. We need to choose two numbers that sum to 107 and are as low as possible. The lowest numbers available are 33 and 74, but their sum is 107, so we fill the second column with these numbers:

[['x' '33' '64' 'x']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['32' '56' '53' '67']
 ['36' '74' 'x' '49']]

For the third column, the sum is 193 and we already have 64, 31, and 53, so the missing number is 193 - 64 - 31 - 53 = 45. We fill the third column with this number:

[['x' '33' '64' 'x']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['32' '56' '53' '67']
 ['36' '74' '45' '49']]

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 166 and we already have 64 and 49, so the sum of the missing numbers is 166 - 64 - 49 = 53. We need to choose two numbers that sum to 53 and are as low as possible. The lowest numbers available are 35 and 18, but their sum is 53, so we fill the diagonal with these numbers:

[['35' '33' '64' '18']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['32' '56' '53' '67']
 ['36' '74' '45' '49']]

So, the final grid is:

[['35' '33' '64' '18']
 ['34' '54' '31' '37']
 ['32' '56' '53' '67']
 ['36' '74' '45' '49']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

/answer_list/ [(0, 0, 35), (0, 1, 33), (0, 3, 18), (1, 2, 31), (1, 3, 37), (2, 0, 32), (2, 3, 67), (3, 1, 74), (3, 2, 45)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 31 to 67 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the minimum possible values that satisfy the given conditions. 

We know that the sum of the second column is 204, and it already contains 59 and 58. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers in the second column is 204 - 59 - 58 = 87. Since we want to minimize the sum of all numbers in the grid, we should choose the smallest possible numbers for these two positions. The smallest number available is 31, so we fill the first position with 31. The next smallest number is 32, but 32 + 31 > 87, so we can't use 32. The next smallest number is 33, and 33 + 31 = 64, which is less than 87. So, we fill the second position with 33. 

Next, we know that the sum of the third row is 203, and it already contains 58. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers in the third row is 203 - 58 = 145. We have already used 31, 33, 59, and 58, so the smallest available number is 32. We fill the first position with 32. The next smallest number is 34, and 34 + 32 = 66, which is less than 145. So, we fill the second position with 34. The next smallest number is 35, and 35 + 34 + 32 = 101, which is less than 145. So, we fill the third position with 35. 

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is 199, and it already contains 54 and 33. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers in the diagonal is 199 - 54 - 33 = 112. We have already used 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 59, and 58, so the smallest available number is 36. We fill the first position with 36. The next smallest number is 37, and 37 + 36 = 73, which is less than 112. So, we fill the second position with 37. 

The final grid is:
 [['31' '59' '52' '54']
 ['36' '33' '34' '62']
 ['32' '58' '35' '37']
 ['37' '54' '63' '42']]

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 31), (1, 0, 36), (1, 1, 33), (1, 2, 34), (2, 0, 32), (2, 2, 35), (2, 3, 37), (3, 0, 37), (3, 1, 54)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 31 to 67 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the minimum possible values from the given range (31 to 67) that are not already in the grid and that satisfy the given conditions. 

We start by filling the second column which has a sum constraint of 224. The current sum of the second column is 98 (40 + 58). So, we need to add 126 (224 - 98) to this column. The minimum possible values that we can add are 31 and 95 (126 - 31). So, we fill the second column with these values. 

Next, we fill the third column which has a sum constraint of 226. The current sum of the third column is 0. So, we need to add 226 to this column. The minimum possible values that we can add are 32, 33, 34, and 127 (226 - 32 - 33 - 34). So, we fill the third column with these values. 

Then, we fill the second row which has a sum constraint of 220. The current sum of the second row is 95 (58 + 37). So, we need to add 125 (220 - 95) to this row. The minimum possible value that we can add is 35 (125 - 90). So, we fill the second row with this value. 

Finally, we fill the third row which has a sum constraint of 216. The current sum of the third row is 91 (47 + 44). So, we need to add 125 (216 - 91) to this row. The minimum possible value that we can add is 36 (125 - 89). So, we fill the third row with this value. 

The final grid is:
 [['31' '40' '32' '33']
 ['35' '58' '34' '37']
 ['47' '95' '36' '44']
 ['45' '31' '127' '42']]

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 31), (0, 2, 32), (0, 3, 33), (1, 0, 35), (1, 2, 34), (2, 1, 95), (2, 2, 36), (3, 1, 31), (3, 2, 127)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the columns and rows where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 205. We already have 65 in the first row and 45 in the third row. So, the sum of the second and fourth row should be 205 - 65 - 45 = 95. Since we want to minimize the sum of all numbers, we should choose the smallest available numbers for these positions. The smallest available numbers are 31 and 32, but since 32 is already in the grid, we choose 31 and 33. We assign 31 to the second row and 33 to the fourth row.

For the third column, the sum should be 218. We already have 59 in the second row. So, the sum of the first, third and fourth row should be 218 - 59 = 159. Again, we choose the smallest available numbers for these positions. The smallest available numbers are 34, 35 and 36, but since 35 is already in the grid, we choose 34, 36 and 37. We assign 34 to the first row, 36 to the third row and 37 to the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum should be 219. We already have 42 and 59 in the first and third column. So, the sum of the second and fourth column should be 219 - 42 - 59 = 118. We choose the smallest available numbers for these positions. The smallest available numbers are 38 and 39. We assign 38 to the second column and 39 to the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum should be 220. We already have 54 and 45 in the first and second column. So, the sum of the third and fourth column should be 220 - 54 - 45 = 121. We choose the smallest available numbers for these positions. The smallest available numbers are 40 and 41. We assign 40 to the third column and 41 to the fourth column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum should be 182. We already have 65 and 35 in the first and fourth row. So, the sum of the second and third row should be 182 - 65 - 35 = 82. We choose the smallest available numbers for these positions. The smallest available numbers are 42 and 43. We assign 42 to the second row and 43 to the third row.

The final grid is:
 [['43' '65' '34' '40']
 ['42' '31' '59' '39']
 ['54' '45' '36' '41']
 ['37' '33' '42' '35']]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 28 to 64 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the sum is 156. We already have 47 and 28 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 156 - 47 - 28 = 81. We can fill in the smallest possible numbers from the given range that add up to 81, which are 29 and 52. We put 29 in the third row because we want to keep the sum of the third row as low as possible. So, we put 52 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum is 185. We already have 40 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 185 - 40 = 145. We can fill in the smallest possible numbers from the given range that add up to 145, which are 30, 31, and 84. We put 30 in the first row, 31 in the fourth row, and 84 in the third row.

For the second row, the sum is 152. We already have 28 and 40 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 152 - 28 - 40 = 84. We can fill in the smallest possible numbers from the given range that add up to 84, which are 32 and 52. But 52 is already used, so we use the next smallest number, which is 53. We put 32 in the first column and 53 in the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum is 158. We already have 29 and 84 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 158 - 29 - 84 = 45. We can fill in the smallest possible numbers from the given range that add up to 45, which are 33 and 12. But 33 is already used, so we use the next smallest number, which is 34. We put 34 in the first column and 11 in the fourth column.

Now, we need to fill in the remaining 'x's in the grid. We can fill in the smallest possible numbers from the given range that are not already used. 

For the first row, we can fill in 31 in the fourth column. For the fourth row, we can fill in 35 in the second column and 36 in the third column.

Finally, we need to check the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid. The sum of the numbers in this diagonal should be 165. The sum of the current numbers in this diagonal is 47 + 40 + 33 + 36 = 156. So, we need to increase the number in the fourth column of the first row by 165 - 156 = 9. So, we replace 31 with 40.

So, the final grid is:
 [['36' '47' '30' '40']
 ['32' '28' '40' '53']
 ['34' '29' '84' '11']
 ['50' '52' '31' '36']]

First, let's fill in the values for the columns and rows where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 218. We already have 50 and 62 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 218 - 50 - 62 = 106. We need to choose two numbers from the range 28 to 64 that add up to 106 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 106 are 44 and 62. However, 62 is already in the grid, so we need to choose the next lowest number, which is 45. So, the two numbers for the second column are 44 and 45.

For the third row, the sum should be 174. We already have 35 in this row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 174 - 35 = 139. We need to choose three numbers from the range 28 to 64 that add up to 139 and are as low as possible. The three lowest numbers that add up to 139 are 44, 45, and 50. However, 44, 45, and 50 are already in the grid, so we need to choose the next lowest numbers, which are 46, 47, and 48. So, the three numbers for the third row are 46, 47, and 48.

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 221. We already have 53 and 35 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 221 - 53 - 35 = 133. We need to choose two numbers from the range 28 to 64 that add up to 133 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 133 are 64 and 69. However, 69 is not in the range 28 to 64, so we need to choose the next lowest numbers, which are 64 and 69. So, the two numbers for the diagonal are 64 and 69.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining 'x' values in the grid. We can choose the lowest numbers from the range 28 to 64 that have not been used yet. These numbers are 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 51, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 28 to 64 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the total sum is 157. We already have 35 in the second row, so we need to find three other numbers that add up to 122 (157 - 35). The smallest three unique numbers from the range that add up to 122 are 28, 29, and 65. We can put 28 in the first row, 29 in the third row, and 65 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the total sum is 200. We already have 60 in the first row and 50 in the third row, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 90 (200 - 60 - 50). The smallest two unique numbers from the range that add up to 90 are 30 and 60. We can put 30 in the second row and 60 in the fourth row. 

For the second row, the total sum is 193. We already have 35 in the first column and 30 in the third column, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 128 (193 - 35 - 30). The smallest two unique numbers from the range that add up to 128 are 31 and 97. We can put 31 in the second column and 97 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the total sum is 158. We already have 29 in the second column and 50 in the fourth column, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 79 (158 - 29 - 50). The smallest two unique numbers from the range that add up to 79 are 32 and 47. We can put 32 in the first column and 47 in the third column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the total sum is 183. We already have 63 in the first row and 37 in the fourth row, so we need to find two other numbers that add up to 83 (183 - 63 - 37). The smallest two unique numbers from the range that add up to 83 are 33 and 50. We can put 33 in the second row and 50 in the third row. 

So, the final grid is:
 [[28, 60, 63, 33]
 [35, 31, 30, 97]
 [32, 29, 47, 50]
 [65, 34, 60, 37]]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers ranging from 6 to 47 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

 [['x' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '41' '17' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' '13' '43']
 ['9' '24' '27' '11']]

We know that the sum of the second column is 144, so the first cell in the second column (row 0, column 1) must be 144 - 41 - 24 = 79. However, this value is outside the range of 6 to 47, so there must be a mistake in the problem statement.

Assuming that the sum of the second column is actually 144 and the sum of the third column is 76, we can calculate the missing values in the second and third columns. The first cell in the second column (row 0, column 1) must be 144 - 41 - 24 = 79, which is outside the range of 6 to 47. The first cell in the third column (row 0, column 2) must be 76 - 17 - 13 = 46, which is within the range of 6 to 47.

The sum of the second row is 116, so the first and last cells in the second row (row 1, column 0 and row 1, column 3) must be 116 - 41 - 17 = 58, which is outside the range of 6 to 47.

The sum of the third row is 124, so the first and second cells in the third row (row 2, column 0 and row 2, column 1) must be 124 - 13 - 43 = 68, which is outside the range of 6 to 47.

The sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 75, so the first cell in the first row (row 0, column 3) must be 75 - 17 - 43 - 11 = 4, which is outside the range of 6 to 47.

Therefore, it is impossible to solve this problem with the given constraints.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 99. We already have 20 and 42 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 99 - 20 - 42 = 37. We need to choose two numbers from the range 6 to 47 that are not already in the grid, sum to 37, and are as small as possible. The smallest pair of numbers that meet these criteria are 18 and 19. We'll put 18 in the second row and 19 in the third row.

For the second row, the sum should be 97. We already have 6 and 40 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 97 - 6 - 40 = 51. We need to choose two numbers from the range 6 to 47 that are not already in the grid, sum to 51, and are as small as possible. The smallest pair of numbers that meet these criteria are 21 and 30. We'll put 21 in the second column and 30 in the third column.

For the third row, the sum should be 107. We already have 29 in this row, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 107 - 29 = 78. We need to choose three numbers from the range 6 to 47 that are not already in the grid, sum to 78, and are as small as possible. The smallest trio of numbers that meet these criteria are 22, 26, and 30. We'll put 22 in the first column, 26 in the second column, and 30 in the fourth column.

For the third column, the sum should be 126. We already have 34 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 126 - 34 = 92. We need to choose three numbers from the range 6 to 47 that are not already in the grid, sum to 92, and are as small as possible. The smallest trio of numbers that meet these criteria are 23, 31, and 38. We'll put 23 in the first row, 31 in the second row, and 38 in the fourth row.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 124. We already have 20 and 29 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 124 - 20 - 29 = 75. We need to choose two numbers from the range 6 to 47 that are not already in the grid, sum to 75, and are as small as possible. The smallest pair of numbers that meet these criteria are 32 and 43.

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second row, the sum is 101 and we already have 28 and 33 filled in. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 101 - 28 - 33 = 40. We can fill in the smallest two numbers from the range that are not already in the grid, which are 6 and 34. 

For the third row, the sum is 108 and we already have 16 and 37 filled in. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 108 - 16 - 37 = 55. We can fill in the smallest two numbers from the range that are not already in the grid, which are 7 and 48. 

For the second column, the sum is 125 and we already have 33 and 18 filled in. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 125 - 33 - 18 = 74. We can fill in the smallest two numbers from the range that are not already in the grid, which are 8 and 66. 

For the third column, the sum is 51 and we already have 7 filled in. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 51 - 7 = 44. We can fill in the smallest three numbers from the range that are not already in the grid, which are 9, 10, and 25. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum is 90 and we already have 23 filled in. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 90 - 23 = 67. We can fill in the smallest three numbers from the range that are not already in the grid, which are 11, 12, and 44. 

The final grid is:

 ['28' '33' '34' '6']

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 128. We already have 38 in the first row and 43 in the third row, so the sum of these two numbers is 81. Therefore, the value in the second row of the second column should be 128 - 81 = 47. 

For the third column, the sum should be 80. We already have 27 in the first row and 34 in the fourth row, so the sum of these two numbers is 61. Therefore, the value in the second row of the third column should be 80 - 61 = 19. 

For the second row, the sum should be 94. We already have 19 in the fourth column, so the value in the first column of the second row should be 94 - 19 = 75. 

For the third row, the sum should be 109. We already have 43 in the second column, so the value in the fourth column of the third row should be 109 - 43 = 66. 

Now, let's fill in the values for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid. The sum should be 99. We already have 26 in the first row and 20 in the fourth row, so the sum of these two numbers is 46. Therefore, the value in the third row of the third column should be 99 - 46 = 53. 

Finally, let's fill in the remaining 'x' values in the grid. 

For the first column, we don't have any constraints, so we can choose the smallest available number, which is 6. 

For the second row of the second column, we already filled in the value as 47. 

For the third row of the third column, we already filled in the value as 53. 

For the fourth column, we don't have any constraints, so we can choose the smallest available number, which is 7. 

So, the final grid is:

 [['26' '38' '27' '7']
 ['6' '47' '19' '19']
 ['42' '43' '53' '66']
 ['42' 'x' '34' '20']]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 13 to 54 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the total sum is 147. We already have 41 in the last row, so the sum of the numbers in the first three rows should be 147 - 41 = 106. Since we want to minimize the total sum of the grid, we should choose the smallest three numbers from the range 13 to 54 that are not already in the grid. These numbers are 13, 14, and 15. We can distribute these numbers in the first three rows of the second column in any order. 

For the third row, the total sum is 114. We already have 16 in the third column, so the sum of the numbers in the first, second, and fourth columns should be 114 - 16 = 98. The smallest three numbers from the range 13 to 54 that are not already in the grid are 17, 18, and 19. We can distribute these numbers in the first, second, and fourth columns of the third row in any order. 

For the second row, the total sum is 159. We already have 51 in the fourth column, so the sum of the numbers in the first, second, and third columns should be 159 - 51 = 108. The smallest three numbers from the range 13 to 54 that are not already in the grid are 20, 21, and 22. We can distribute these numbers in the first, second, and third columns of the second row in any order. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the total sum is 150. We already have 37 and 43 in the third and fourth rows, so the sum of the numbers in the first and second rows should be 150 - 37 - 43 = 70.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 13 to 54 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second row, the sum is 158. We already have 28, 47, and 42 in the row. So, the missing number is 158 - 28 - 47 - 42 = 41. 

For the third row, the sum is 87. We already have 16 and 30 and 24 in the row. So, the missing number is 87 - 16 - 30 - 24 = 17.

For the second column, the sum is 135. We already have 22, 47, and 16 in the column. So, the missing number is 135 - 22 - 47 - 16 = 50.

For the third column, the sum is 153. We already have 42, 30 in the column. So, the missing number is 153 - 42 - 30 = 81. But 81 is not in the range 13 to 54. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third column. We can reduce the number in the second row, third column from 42 to 13, the lowest possible number in the range. Then, the missing number in the third column becomes 153 - 13 - 30 = 110, which is still not in the range. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the third column again. We can increase the number in the third row, third column from 30 to 54, the highest possible number in the range. Then, the missing number in the third column becomes 153 - 13 - 54 = 86, which is in the range.

Now, let's fill in the numbers for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid. The sum is 140. We already have 24 in the diagonal. So, the missing numbers sum to 140 - 24 = 116. We can distribute this sum among the three missing numbers such that they are unique and as low as possible. We can choose 13, 14, and 89 for the missing numbers. But 89 is not in the range 13 to 54. So, we need to adjust the numbers in the diagonal. We can increase the number in the second row, fourth column from 41 to 54, the highest possible number in the range. Then, the missing numbers in the diagonal sum to 116 - 54 = 62. We can choose 13, 14, and 35 for the missing numbers, which are all in the range.

Finally, we fill in the remaining 'x's in the grid with the lowest possible numbers in the range that are not already in the grid. We can choose 15, 16, and 17 for the missing numbers.

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 13), (0, 2, 14), (0, 3, 35), (1, 3, 54), (2, 1, 17), (3, 0, 15), (3, 1, 16), (3, 2, 17), (3, 3, 50)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 13 to 54 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows that have specified sums. 

For the second column, the sum is 146. We already have 46 in the first row, so we need to find numbers for the remaining three rows that add up to 100. The smallest three unique numbers that add up to 100 are 13, 14, and 73. We can put 13 in the second row, 14 in the third row, and 73 in the fourth row.

For the third column, the sum is 168. We already have 36 in the second row, so we need to find numbers for the remaining three rows that add up to 132. The smallest three unique numbers that add up to 132 are 15, 16, and 101. We can put 15 in the first row, 16 in the third row, and 101 in the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum is 118. We already have 36 and 15 in the third and fourth columns, so we need to find numbers for the remaining two columns that add up to 67. The smallest two unique numbers that add up to 67 are 17 and 50. We can put 17 in the first column and 50 in the second column.

For the third row, the sum is 120. We already have 47 and 25 in the first and fourth columns, so we need to find numbers for the remaining two columns that add up to 48. The smallest two unique numbers that add up to 48 are 18 and 30. We can put 18 in the second column and 30 in the third column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 91. We already have 22 and 53 in the first and fourth rows, so we need to find numbers for the remaining two rows that add up to 16. The smallest two unique numbers that add up to 16 are 8 and 8. However, we need unique numbers, so we can use 7 and 9. We can put 7 in the second row and 9 in the third row.

So, the final grid is:
 [[17, 46, 15, 22]
 [13, 50, 36, 15]

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 35 to 76 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the given numbers and 'x' for the unknowns:

[['x' 'x' 'x' '60']
 ['72' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['63' '70' 'x' 'x']
 ['61' '75' 'x' 'x']]

Next, we need to calculate the missing values in the grid. 

For the second column, the sum should be 247. We already have 72 and 70 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 247 - 72 - 70 = 105. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 35 to 76 that are not already in the grid, which are 35 and 36. We assign 35 to the first row and 36 to the fourth row because we want the sum of all numbers in the grid to be as low as possible.

For the third column, the sum should be 236. We already have 75 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 236 - 75 = 161. We can choose the smallest three numbers from the range 35 to 76 that are not already in the grid, which are 37, 38, and 39. We assign 37 to the second row, 38 to the third row, and 39 to the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum should be 231. We already have 72 and 37 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 231 - 72 - 37 = 122. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 35 to 76 that are not already in the grid, which are 40 and 41. We assign 40 to the third column and 41 to the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum should be 259. We already have 63, 70, and 38 in this row, so the remaining number should be 259 - 63 - 70 - 38 = 88. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 234. We already have 60 and 88 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 234 - 60 - 88 = 86. We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 35 to 76 that are not already in the grid, which are 42 and 44. We assign 42 to the second row and 44 to the third row.

So, the final grid is:

[['35' 'x' 'x' '60']
 ['72' '42' '40' '41']
 ['63' '70' '38' '88']
 ['61' '36' '39' 'x']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the sum is 188. We already have 42 in the grid, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 188 - 42 = 146. We want to keep the sum as low as possible, so we'll choose the two smallest numbers from the range that we haven't used yet, which are 35 and 36. We'll put 35 in the second row and 36 in the fourth row. 

For the third column, the sum is 234. We already have 50 and 57 in the grid, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 234 - 50 - 57 = 127. Again, we'll choose the two smallest numbers from the range that we haven't used yet, which are 37 and 38. We'll put 37 in the second row and 38 in the fourth row. 

For the second row, the sum is 247. We already have 35 and 37 in the grid, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 247 - 35 - 37 = 175. We'll choose the two smallest numbers from the range that we haven't used yet, which are 39 and 40. We'll put 39 in the first column and 40 in the fourth column. 

For the third row, the sum is 238. We already have 68, 40, and 57 in the grid, so we need to find one number that is equal to 238 - 68 - 40 - 57 = 73. We'll put 73 in the fourth column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 215. We already have 50 and 42 in the grid, so we need to find two numbers that add up to 215 - 50 - 42 = 123. We'll choose the two smallest numbers from the range that we haven't used yet, which are 41 and 43. We'll put 41 in the first row and 43 in the fourth row.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 43 to 84 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second row, we know that the sum should be 227 and we already have 53 and 43 in the row. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 227 - 53 - 43 = 131. To keep the total sum as low as possible, we should choose the two smallest numbers from the range that are not already in the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 43 to 84 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the columns and rows where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 240. We already have 51 in the grid, so we need to find three numbers that sum to 189 (240 - 51). We can choose the smallest three numbers from the range 43 to 84 that are not already in the grid, which are 43, 44, and 45. We can put these numbers in the second column in the rows where 'x' is present. 

For the third column, the sum should be 226. We already have 64 in the grid, so we need to find three numbers that sum to 162 (226 - 64). We can choose the smallest three numbers from the range 43 to 84 that are not already in the grid and are not 43, 44, and 45, which are 46, 47, and 48. We can put these numbers in the third column in the rows where 'x' is present. 

For the second row, the sum should be 255. We already have 68 in the grid, so we need to find three numbers that sum to 187 (255 - 68). We can choose the smallest three numbers from the range 43 to 84 that are not already in the grid and are not 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48, which are 49, 50, and 52. We can put these numbers in the second row in the columns where 'x' is present. 

For the third row, the sum should be 268. We already have 139 in the grid (64 + 75), so we need to find two numbers that sum to 129 (268 - 139). We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 43 to 84 that are not already in the grid and are not 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 52, which are 53 and 54. We can put these numbers in the third row in the columns where 'x' is present. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum should be 264. We already have 140 in the grid (65 + 75), so we need to find two numbers that sum to 124 (264 - 140). We can choose the smallest two numbers from the range 43 to 84 that are not already in the grid and are not 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, and 54, which are 55 and 56. We can put these numbers in the diagonal where 'x' is present.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's calculate the missing values in the second row and third column. The sum of the second row should be 253 and we already have '82' and '54' in the row. So, the sum of the missing values should be 253 - 82 - 54 = 117. Similarly, the sum of the third column should be 204 and we already have '43' and '44' in the column. So, the sum of the missing values should be 204 - 43 - 44 = 117. Since the sum of the missing values in the second row and third column is the same, we can conclude that the missing values in the second row and third column are the same. 

Next, let's calculate the missing value in the second column. The sum of the second column should be 277 and we already have '53', '82', and '62' in the column. So, the missing value should be 277 - 53 - 82 - 62 = 80.

Finally, let's calculate the missing values in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner. The sum of the diagonal should be 252 and we already have '72' and '44' in the diagonal. So, the sum of the missing values should be 252 - 72 - 44 = 136. Since we already know that the missing value in the second column is '80', the other missing value in the diagonal should be 136 - 80 = 56.

So, the solution is [(1, 0, 56), (1, 3, 61), (2, 0, 56), (2, 3, 61), (3, 1, 80), (3, 2, 56), (3, 3, 80)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's calculate the missing values for the rows and columns where the sum is specified. 

For the second row, the sum is 221 and we already have the numbers 44 and 39. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 221 - 44 - 39 = 138. 

For the third row, the sum is 257 and we already have the numbers 70 and 64. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 257 - 70 - 64 = 123. 

For the second column, the sum is 252 and we already have the numbers 70 and 67. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 252 - 70 - 67 = 115. 

For the third column, the sum is 238 and we already have the numbers 80, 39 and 64. So, the sum of the missing number is 238 - 80 - 39 - 64 = 55. 

Now, let's fill in the 'x' values in the grid. 

For the second row, we need to find two numbers that sum to 138 and are as low as possible. The lowest two numbers in the range that are not already in the grid are 37 and 38. However, these two numbers sum to 75, which is less than 138. So, we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 39 and 40, but 39 is already in the grid. So, we choose 40 and 41, which sum to 81. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 42 and 43, but 42 is already in the grid. So, we choose 43 and 44, which sum to 87. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 45 and 46, which sum to 91. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 47 and 48, which sum to 95. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 49 and 50, which sum to 99. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 51 and 52, which sum to 103. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 53 and 54, which sum to 107. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 55 and 56, which sum to 111. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 57 and 58, which sum to 115. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 59 and 60, which sum to 119. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 61 and 62, which sum to 123. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 63 and 64, but 64 is already in the grid. So, we choose 65 and 66, which sum to 131. This is still less than 138, so we need to find two other numbers. The next lowest numbers are 67 and 68, but 67 is already in the grid.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 37 to 83 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the grid with the given numbers and 'x' for the unknowns:

[['x' '48' '64' '67']
 ['x' '50' '61' 'x']
 ['42' 'x' 'x' '74']
 ['x' 'x' '72' 'x']]

Next, we need to calculate the missing numbers in the rows and columns with specified sums. 

For the second column, the sum is 214. The known numbers in this column are 48 and 50, so the sum of the unknowns is 214 - 48 - 50 = 116. The smallest two numbers in the range 37 to 83 that are not already in the grid are 37 and 38. We can assign these two numbers to the unknowns in the second column.

For the third column, the sum is 240. The known numbers in this column are 64 and 61, so the sum of the unknowns is 240 - 64 - 61 = 115. The smallest two numbers in the range 37 to 83 that are not already in the grid and are not 37 and 38 are 39 and 40. We can assign these two numbers to the unknowns in the third column.

For the second row, the sum is 213. The known numbers in this row are 50 and 61, so the sum of the unknowns is 213 - 50 - 61 = 102. The smallest two numbers in the range 37 to 83 that are not already in the grid and are not 37, 38, 39, and 40 are 41 and 42. However, 42 is already in the grid, so we can use 41 and the next smallest number, 43.

For the third row, the sum is 197. The known numbers in this row are 42 and 74, so the sum of the unknowns is 197 - 42 - 74 = 81. The smallest two numbers in the range 37 to 83 that are not already in the grid and are not 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 43 are 44 and 45. We can assign these two numbers to the unknowns in the third row.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 215. The known numbers in this diagonal are 67 and 72, so the sum of the unknowns is 215 - 67 - 72 = 76. The smallest two numbers in the range 37 to 83 that are not already in the grid and are not 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45 are 46 and 47. We can assign these two numbers to the unknowns in the diagonal.

The final grid is:

[['46' '48' '64' '67']

 ['42' '37' '39' '74']
 ['47' '38' '40' '45']]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 37 to 83 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's calculate the missing values for the rows and columns where the sum is specified. 

For the second row, the sum is 233 and we already have the number 56. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 233 - 56 = 177.

For the third row, the sum is 237 and we already have the numbers 49 and 43. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 237 - 49 - 43 = 145.

For the second column, the sum is 258 and we already have the numbers 76 and 61. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 258 - 76 - 61 = 121.

For the third column, the sum is 247 and we already have the numbers 68 and 61. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 247 - 68 - 61 = 118.

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 242 and we already have the numbers 69 and 43. So, the sum of the missing numbers is 242 - 69 - 43 = 130.

Now, let's fill in the grid with the lowest possible unique integers such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts. 

For the second row, we can fill in the missing numbers with 59, 58, and 60. 

For the third row, we can fill in the missing numbers with 51 and 94.

For the second column, we can fill in the missing numbers with 37 and 84.

For the third column, we can fill in the missing numbers with 38 and 80.

For the diagonal, we can fill in the missing numbers with 39 and 91.

So, the final grid is:

 [['72' '76' '68' '69']
 ['56' '59' '58' '60']
 ['49' '51' '94' '43']
 ['37' '84' '38' '91']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 183. We already have 48 in the first row, so we need to find numbers for the second, third and fourth rows such that their sum is 183 - 48 = 135. We also know that the sum of the third row should be 154, and we already have 28, 33 and 26 in that row. So, the number in the second column of the third row should be 154 - 28 - 33 - 26 = 67. This leaves us with 135 - 67 = 68 for the second and fourth rows of the second column. 

For the third column, the sum should be 202. We already have 63 in the second row and 33 in the third row, so we need to find numbers for the first and fourth rows such that their sum is 202 - 63 - 33 = 106. We also know that the sum of the second row should be 190, and we already have 63 in that row. So, the number in the first column of the second row should be 190 - 63 = 127. This leaves us with 106 - 39 = 67 for the first row of the third column. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 183. We already have 39 in the bottom left corner, so we need to find numbers for the other three corners such that their sum is 183 - 39 = 144. We also know that the number in the top right corner should be the same as the number in the first row of the third column, which is 67. This leaves us with 144 - 67 = 77 for the top left and bottom right corners. 

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining 'x' values such that the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. We can do this by choosing the smallest available numbers from the given range. 

So, the final grid is:

 [['27' '48' '67' '77']
 ['127' '68' '63' '68']
 ['28' '67' '33' '26']
 ['22' '0' '39' '39']]

And the solution as a list of tuples is:

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, we know that the sum must be 139 and we already have 24, 27, and 41 filled in. So, the missing number is 139 - 24 - 27 - 41 = 47. 

For the third row, we know that the sum must be 178 and we already have 22 and 37 filled in. So, the missing numbers must sum up to 178 - 22 - 37 = 119. We want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, so we choose the two smallest numbers from the remaining numbers in the range 22 to 68 that are not already in the grid and that sum up to 119. These numbers are 23 and 96. 

For the second column, we know that the sum must be 187 and we already have 24, 22, and 29 filled in. So, the missing number is 187 - 24 - 22 - 29 = 112. 

For the third column, we know that the sum must be 186 and we already have 27, 23, and 46 filled in. So, the missing number is 186 - 27 - 23 - 46 = 90. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, we know that the sum must be 160 and we already have 41, 23, and 29 filled in. So, the missing number is 160 - 41 - 23 - 29 = 67. 

So, the final grid is:

 [['67' '112' '90' 'x']
 ['24' '47' '27' '41']
 ['22' '37' '23' '96']
 ['29' 'x' 'x' '46']]

The remaining 'x's can be filled with any unique numbers from the range 22 to 68 that are not already in the grid. We want to keep the sum of all numbers as low as possible, so we choose the smallest numbers from the remaining numbers. These numbers are 25, 26, and 28. 

So, the final grid is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have the sum constraints. 

For the second row, the sum is given as 211. We already have the values 37, 61, and 54 in this row, which sum up to 152. So, the missing value in this row is 211 - 152 = 59. 

For the third row, the sum is given as 161. We already have the value 62 in this row. So, the missing values in this row should sum up to 161 - 62 = 99. Since we want the sum of all the numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest possible unique numbers for these missing values. The smallest possible unique numbers in the given range that sum up to 99 are 22, 23, and 54. However, 54 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, which is 24. So, the missing values in the third row are 22, 23, and 24.

For the second column, the sum is given as 143. We already have the values 61 and 30 in this column, which sum up to 91. So, the missing value in this column is 143 - 91 = 52.

For the third column, the sum is given as 170. We already have the values 32 and 59 in this column, which sum up to 91. So, the missing value in this column is 170 - 91 = 79.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner, the sum is given as 146. We already have the values 32 and 44 in this diagonal, which sum up to 76. So, the missing value in this diagonal is 146 - 76 = 70.

So, the final grid is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers ranging from 22 to 68 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 177. We already have 35, 39, and 55 in this column, which sum up to 129. So, the missing number in this column should be 177 - 129 = 48. 

For the third column, the sum should be 192. We already have 60 and 54 in this column, which sum up to 114. So, the missing number in this column should be 192 - 114 = 78.

So, we need to adjust the numbers in this column again. Let's decrease the number 58 to 56 and increase the number 56 to 58. Now, the sum of the numbers in this column is 114 - 2 + 2 = 114. So, the missing number in this column should be 192 - 114 = 78. But 78 is still not in the range of 22 to 68. So, we need to adjust the numbers in this column again. Let's decrease the number 56 to 54 and increase the number 58 to 60. Now, the sum of the numbers in this column is 114 - 2 + 2 = 114. So, the missing number in this column should be 192 - 114 = 78. But 78 is still not in the range of 22 to 68. So, we need to adjust the numbers in this column again. Let's decrease the number 54 to 52 and increase the number 60 to 62.

So, the missing number in this column should be 192 - 114 = 78. But 78 is still not in the range of 22 to 68. So, we need to adjust the numbers in this column again.

To solve this problem, we need to fill the grid with unique integers from 41 to 92 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill the grid with the minimum possible values that satisfy the given conditions. 

We know that the sum of the second column is 240, and we already have 41, 73, and 43 in this column. So, the missing value in the second column (at position (3,1)) is 240 - 41 - 73 - 43 = 83.

Next, we know that the sum of the third column is 266, and we already have 67 in this column. So, the missing value in the third column (at position (1,2)) is 266 - 67 = 199. But this value is greater than 92, which is the maximum value we can use. So, we need to adjust the values in the third column. We can increase the value at position (3,1) to 92, which is the maximum value we can use. Then, the missing value in the third column (at position (1,2)) is 266 - 67 - 92 = 107, which is still greater than 92. So, we need to increase the value at position (3,1) again. We can increase it to 92 + (107 - 92) = 107. Then, the missing value in the third column (at position (1,2)) is 266 - 67 - 107 = 92, which is within the allowed range.

Next, we know that the sum of the second row is 298, and we already have 73 and 91 in this row. So, the missing value in the second row (at position (1,0)) is 298 - 73 - 91 = 134. But this value is greater than 92, which is the maximum value we can use. So, we need to adjust the values in the second row. We can increase the value at position (1,2) to 92, which is the maximum value we can use. Then, the missing value in the second row (at position (1,0)) is 298 - 73 - 92 = 133, which is still greater than 92. So, we need to increase the value at position (1,2) again. We can increase it to 92 + (133 - 92) = 133. Then, the missing value in the second row (at position (1,0)) is 298 - 73 - 133 = 92, which is within the allowed range.

Finally, we know that the sum of the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 299, and we already have 41, 91, and 76 in this diagonal. So, the missing value in this diagonal (at position (0,3)) is 299 - 41 - 91 - 76 = 91. But this value is equal to 91, which is already used in the grid. So, we need to adjust the values in the diagonal. We can increase the value at position (0,3) to 92, which is the maximum value we can use. Then, the missing value in the diagonal (at position (0,3)) is 299 - 41 - 91 - 76 + 1 = 92, which is within the allowed range.

So, the final grid is:
 [['92' '41' '67' '92']
 ['92' '73' '133' '91']
 ['83' '43' '107' '76']
 ['80' '107' '92' '86']]

And the solution is:
[(0, 0, 92), (0, 3, 92), (1, 0, 92), (1, 2, 133), (2, 0, 83), (2, 2, 107), (3, 1, 107), (3, 2, 92)]

llm code run result: [(0, 0, 92), (0, 3, 92), (1, 0, 92), (1, 2, 133), (2, 0, 83), (2, 2, 107), (3, 1, 107), (3, 2, 92)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 244. We already have 57 and 78 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 244 - 57 - 78 = 109. We need to choose two numbers that add up to 109 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 54 and 55. So, the 'x' in the first row, second column will be replaced with 54 and the 'x' in the fourth row, second column will be replaced with 55.

For the third column, the sum should be 295. We already have 88 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 295 - 88 = 207. We need to choose three numbers that add up to 207 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 65, 70, and 72. So, the 'x' in the first row, third column will be replaced with 65, the 'x' in the second row, third column will be replaced with 70, and the 'x' in the fourth row, third column will be replaced with 72.

For the second row, the sum should be 266. We already have 77, 78, and 56 in this row, so the remaining number should be 266 - 77 - 78 - 56 = 55. But 55 is already used in the grid. So, we need to adjust the values in the second row and second column. Let's replace 78 in the second row, second column with 56 and replace 56 in the second row, fourth column with 77. Now, the sum of the second row is 266 and the sum of the second column is 244.

For the third row, the sum should be 261. We already have 51, 62, and 88 in this row, so the remaining number should be 261 - 51 - 62 - 88 = 60. So, the 'x' in the third row, fourth column will be replaced with 60.

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 265. We already have 57 and 88 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 265 - 57 - 88 = 120. We need to choose two numbers that add up to 120 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 59 and 61. So, the 'x' in the first row, fourth column will be replaced with 59 and the 'x' in the fourth row, first column will be replaced with 61.

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining 'x' values in the fourth row. We can choose the lowest available numbers. Let's choose 62 for the second column, 63 for the third column, and 64 for the fourth column.

So, the final grid will be:

 [['53' '54' '65' '59']
 ['77' '56' '70' '77']
 ['51' '62' '88' '60']
 ['61' '55' '72' '64']]

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second row, the sum is 270 and we already have 54. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 270 - 54 = 216. We need to choose the smallest three numbers from the range 41 to 92 that are not already in the grid. The smallest three numbers are 41, 42, and 43. However, 41 + 42 + 43 = 126 which is less than 216. Therefore, we need to choose larger numbers. The next smallest numbers are 44, 45, and 46. However, 44 is already in the grid. So, we choose 45, 46, and 47. 45 + 46 + 47 = 138 which is still less than 216. We continue this process until we find three numbers that sum to 216. The numbers are 71, 72, and 73. 

For the third column, the sum is 236 and we already have 44 and 51. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 236 - 44 - 51 = 141. We need to choose the smallest two numbers from the range 41 to 92 that are not already in the grid and are not 71, 72, or 73. The smallest two numbers are 41 and 42. However, 41 + 42 = 83 which is less than 141. Therefore, we need to choose larger numbers. The next smallest numbers are 43 and 44. However, 44 is already in the grid. So, we choose 43 and 45. 43 + 45 = 88 which is still less than 141. We continue this process until we find two numbers that sum to 141. The numbers are 69 and 70. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 301 and we already have 83. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 301 - 83 = 218. We need to choose the smallest three numbers from the range 41 to 92 that are not already in the grid and are not 69, 70, 71, 72, or 73. The smallest three numbers are 41, 42, and 43.

So, we choose 46, 47, and 48. 46 + 47 + 48 = 141 which is still less than 218. We continue this process until we find three numbers that sum to 218. The numbers are 74, 75, and 76. 

Finally, we fill in the remaining 'x' values with the smallest numbers from the range 41 to 92 that are not already in the grid.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 41 to 92 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's calculate the missing values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, the sum is 291. We already have 91 and 71 in this row, so the sum of the missing values is 291 - 91 - 71 = 129. 

For the third row, the sum is 301. We already have 60 in this row, so the sum of the missing values is 301 - 60 = 241. 

For the second column, the sum is 262. We already have 50 and 91 in this column, so the sum of the missing values is 262 - 50 - 91 = 121. 

For the third column, the sum is 272. We already have 47 in this column, so the sum of the missing values is 272 - 47 = 225. 

For the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 256. We already have 65 and 60 in this diagonal, so the sum of the missing values is 256 - 65 - 60 = 131. 

Now, let's fill in the grid with the lowest possible unique integers that satisfy these constraints. 

For the second row, we can fill in the missing values with 64 and 65, which sum to 129. 

For the third row, we can fill in the missing values with 60, 61, and 120, which sum to 241. 

For the second column, we can fill in the missing values with 60 and 61, which sum to 121. 

For the third column, we can fill in the missing values with 64, 65, and 96, which sum to 225. 

For the diagonal, we can fill in the missing values with 66 and 65, which sum to 131. 

Finally, we can fill in the remaining 'x' values with the lowest possible unique integers that have not been used yet.

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 11 to 62 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 148. We already have 52 and 13 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 148 - 52 - 13 = 83. We need to choose two numbers that add up to 83 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 83 are 41 and 42. We can put 41 in the first row and 42 in the fourth row.

For the third column, the sum should be 109. We already have 20 and 16 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 109 - 20 - 16 = 73. The two lowest numbers that add up to 73 are 36 and 37. We can put 36 in the first row and 37 in the third row.

For the second row, the sum should be 105. We already have 52 and 20 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 105 - 52 - 20 = 33. The two lowest numbers that add up to 33 are 11 and 22. We can put 11 in the first column and 22 in the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum should be 115. We already have 41 and 13 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 115 - 41 - 13 = 61. The two lowest numbers that add up to 61 are 30 and 31. We can put 30 in the second column and 31 in the fourth column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 134. We already have 11 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 134 - 11 = 123. The three lowest numbers that add up to 123 are 40, 41, and 42. We can put 40 in the first row, 41 in the second row, and 42 in the third row.

The final grid is:
 [[41, 41, 36, 40]
 [11, 52, 20, 22]
 [41, 30, 37, 31]
 [54, 42, 16, 11]]

So, the solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, the column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

Failed to map the elements in the list to the indicated problem state data type
To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 33 to 84 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the numbers for the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second column, the sum is 259. We already have 61 and 48 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 259 - 61 - 48 = 150. Since we want to minimize the total sum of the grid, we should choose the smallest two numbers that are not already in the grid. The smallest number not in the grid is 34, and the next smallest is 35. So, we fill in the first and second rows of the second column with 34 and 35 respectively.

For the third column, the sum is 252. We already have 33 in this column, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 252 - 33 = 219. Again, we should choose the smallest three numbers that are not already in the grid. The smallest numbers not in the grid are 36, 37, and 38. So, we fill in the first, second, and third rows of the third column with 36, 37, and 38 respectively.

For the second row, the sum is 269. We already have 35 and 37 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 269 - 35 - 37 = 197. We should choose the smallest two numbers that are not already in the grid. The smallest numbers not in the grid are 39 and 40. However, 40 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, which is 41. So, we fill in the first and fourth columns of the second row with 39 and 41 respectively.

For the third row, the sum is 234. We already have 49, 61, and 38 in this row, so the remaining number should be 234 - 49 - 61 - 38 = 86. However, 86 is not in the range 33 to 84. This means that we made a mistake in our calculations. The mistake is that we chose the smallest numbers for the second and third columns without considering the constraints for the second and third rows. 

Let's correct this mistake. For the second row, the sum of the numbers in the second and third columns should be 269 - 39 - 41 = 189. For the third row, the sum of the numbers in the second and third columns should be 234 - 49 = 185. The only way to satisfy these constraints is to swap the numbers in the second and third columns for the second and third rows. So, we put 38 in the second column and 37 in the third column for the second row, and we put 35 in the second column and 36 in the third column for the third row.

Now, the sum for the third row is 234 - 49 - 35 - 36 = 114. The smallest number not in the grid is 42, so we fill in the fourth column of the third row with 42.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum is 178. We already have 40 and 35 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 178 - 40 - 35 = 103. The smallest two numbers not in the grid are 43 and 44. However, 44 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, which is 45. So, we fill in the first column of the first row and the third column of the fourth row with 43 and 45 respectively.

The final grid is:
 [[43, 34, 45, 40],
 [39, 38, 37, 41],
 [49, 35, 36, 42],
 [33, 48, 54, 54]]

So, the solution is [(0, 0, 43), (0, 1, 34), (0, 2, 45), (1, 0, 39), (1, 1, 38), (1, 2, 37), (1, 3, 41), (2, 1, 35), (2, 2, 36), (2, 3, 42), (3, 2, 54)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers ranging from 33 to 84 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values and calculate the remaining sums for the rows, columns, and diagonal. 

Grid:
 [['68' 'x' 'x' '76']
 ['74' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' 'x' '82' 'x']
 ['66' 'x' '35' 'x']]

Row sums: [None, 229-74, 249-82, None]
Column sums: [None, 189, 204-68-74-66, None]
Diagonal sum: 219-68-35

Next, we fill in the 'x' values starting from the top left corner and moving to the right and down, choosing the smallest possible unique integer that satisfies the constraints. 

For the first 'x' in the second column, we choose 33, which is the smallest possible integer. This leaves us with a column sum of 189-33=156 and a row sum of 229-74-33=122. 

For the second 'x' in the second column, we choose 34, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of 156-34=122 and a row sum of 249-82-34=133. 

For the third 'x' in the second column, we choose 35, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of 122-35=87 and a row sum of None. 

For the first 'x' in the third column, we choose 36, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of 204-68-74-66-36=60 and a row sum of None. 

For the second 'x' in the third column, we choose 37, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of 60-37=23 and a row sum of 229-74-33-37=85. 

For the third 'x' in the third column, we choose 38, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of 23-38=-15 and a row sum of 249-82-34-38=95. 

Since the column sum is negative, we have made a mistake. We need to choose a smaller integer for the third 'x' in the third column. We choose 23, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique and less than 38. This leaves us with a column sum of 0 and a row sum of 249-82-34-23=110. 

For the first 'x' in the fourth column, we choose 39, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of None and a row sum of 229-74-33-37-39=46. 

For the second 'x' in the fourth column, we choose 40, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of None and a row sum of 249-82-34-23-40=70. 

For the third 'x' in the fourth column, we choose 41, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique. This leaves us with a column sum of None and a row sum of None. 

Finally, we check the diagonal sum. The sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid is 219-68-35-41=75. Since this is not equal to the diagonal sum of 219, we have made a mistake. We need to choose a smaller integer for the third 'x' in the fourth column. We choose 75, which is the smallest possible integer that is still unique and less than 41. This leaves us with a diagonal sum of 0. 

The final grid is:

 [['68' '33' '36' '76']
 ['74' '34' '37' '39']
 ['23' '35' '82' '40']
 ['66' '87' '23' '75']]

The solution is provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple contains three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

LLM solution is NOT feasible LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

Let's start by filling in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum must be 239. We already have 62 in the first row, so we need to find three numbers that sum to 239 - 62 = 177. We also know that the numbers must be unique and between 30 and 86. Let's choose the three smallest numbers in this range that are not already in the grid: 30, 31, and 32. However, 32 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, 33. These numbers sum to 30 + 31 + 33 = 94, which is less than 177. Therefore, we need to choose larger numbers. Let's choose 58, 59, and 60, which sum to 177. We can put 58 in the third row, 59 in the fourth row, and 60 in the second row.

For the third column, the sum must be 192. We already have 32 and 34 in the second and third rows, so we need to find two numbers that sum to 192 - 32 - 34 = 126. Let's choose the two smallest numbers in this range that are not already in the grid and are greater than 30: 63 and 64. These numbers sum to 127, which is greater than 126. Therefore, we need to choose smaller numbers. Let's choose 62 and 64, which sum to 126. We can put 62 in the first row and 64 in the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum must be 220. We already have 62, 60, and 32 in the first, second, and third columns, so we need to find a number that is 220 - 62 - 60 - 32 = 66. The number 66 is already in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, 67. However, 67 is also in the grid, so we choose the next smallest number, 68.

For the third row, the sum must be 184. We already have 66, 58, and 34 in the first, second, and third columns, so we need to find a number that is 184 - 66 - 58 - 34 = 26. However, 26 is not in the range 30 to 86, so we choose the smallest number in this range, 30.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum must be 199. We already have 67, 32, 34, and 35 in the diagonal, so we need to find a number that is 199 - 67 - 32 - 34 - 35 = 31. However, 31 is not in the range 30 to 86, so we choose the smallest number in this range, 30.

Therefore, the solution is [(0, 1, 62), (0, 2, 64), (1, 1, 60), (2, 1, 58), (2, 3, 30), (3, 0, 59), (3, 1, 30)].

LLM solution is feasible!! LLM solution is NOT correct 
To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

[['32' '75' '36' 'x']
 ['x' '83' 'x' 'x']
 ['x' '77' '58' '44']
 ['x' '60' 'x' 'x']]

We can start by calculating the missing values in the rows and columns where we have the total sum. 

For the second row, the sum is 244 and we already have the number 83. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers is 244 - 83 = 161.

For the third row, the sum is 251 and we already have the numbers 77, 58, and 44. So, the remaining number is 251 - 77 - 58 - 44 = 72.

For the second column, the sum is 295 and we already have the numbers 75, 83, and 77. So, the remaining number is 295 - 75 - 83 - 77 = 60.

For the third column, the sum is 204 and we already have the numbers 36, 58, and 60. So, the remaining number is 204 - 36 - 58 - 60 = 50.

Now, let's fill in these values in the grid:

[['32' '75' '36' 'x']
 ['x' '83' '50' 'x']
 ['72' '77' '58' '44']
 ['60' '60' 'x' 'x']]

Next, we need to calculate the missing values in the diagonal. The sum of the diagonal is 237 and we already have the numbers 75, 50, and 44. So, the remaining number is 237 - 75 - 50 - 44 = 68.

Let's fill in this value in the grid:

[['32' '75' '36' 'x']
 ['x' '83' '50' '68']
 ['72' '77' '58' '44']
 ['60' '60' 'x' 'x']]

Finally, we need to fill in the remaining 'x' values. Since we want the sum of all the numbers in the grid to be as low as possible, we should choose the smallest available numbers. The smallest available numbers in the range 30 to 86 that we haven't used yet are 30, 31, 33, and 34.

Let's fill in these values in the grid:

[['32' '75' '36' '30']
 ['31' '83' '50' '68']
 ['72' '77' '58' '44']
 ['60' '60' '33' '34']]

So, the final solution is:

/answer_list/ [(0, 3, 30), (1, 0, 31), (1, 2, 50), (1, 3, 68), (2, 0, 72), (3, 0, 60), (3, 2, 33), (3, 3, 34)]

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second column, the sum should be 260. We already have 39 and 60 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 260 - 39 - 60 = 161. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 86 that add up to 161 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 161 are 80 and 81. We can put 80 in the first row and 81 in the fourth row.

For the third column, the sum should be 216. We already have 50 and 46 in this column, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 216 - 50 - 46 = 120. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 86 that add up to 120 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 120 are 59 and 61. We can put 59 in the third row and 61 in the fourth row.

For the second row, the sum should be 183. We already have 39 and 46 in this row, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 183 - 39 - 46 = 98. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 86 that add up to 98 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 98 are 48 and 50. However, 50 is already in the grid, so we need to choose the next lowest number, which is 51. We can put 48 in the first column and 51 in the fourth column.

For the third row, the sum should be 217. We already have 34, 60, and 59 in this row, so the remaining number should be 217 - 34 - 60 - 59 = 64. We can put 64 in the second column.

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, the sum should be 214. We already have 50 and 68 in this diagonal, so the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 214 - 50 - 68 = 96. We need to choose two numbers from the range 30 to 86 that add up to 96 and are as low as possible. The two lowest numbers that add up to 96 are 47 and 49. We can put 47 in the second row and 49 in the third row.

The final grid is:
 [['70' '80' '50' '48']
 ['47' '39' '46' '51']
 ['34' '64' '59' '49']
 ['81' '61' 'x' '68']]

We still have one 'x' left in the grid. This 'x' can be any number from the range 30 to 86 that is not already in the grid and is as low as possible. The lowest number that is not already in the grid is 30. We can put 30 in the fourth row and third column.

The final grid is:
 [['70' '80' '50' '48']
 ['47' '39' '46' '51']
 ['34' '64' '59' '49']
 ['81' '61' '30' '68']]

So, the solution is [(0, 1, 80), (0, 3, 48), (1, 0, 47), (1, 3, 51), (2, 2, 59), (2, 3, 49), (3, 0, 81), (3, 1, 61), (3, 2, 30)].

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the grid with unique integers from 36 to 92 such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the known values in the grid:

[['44' 'x' 'x' 'x']
 ['90' '52' 'x' '91']
 ['x' '58' 'x' '62']
 ['x' '80' 'x' 'x']]

We know that the sum of the second column is 279, so we can calculate the value of the first 'x' in the second column as 279 - 52 - 58 - 80 = 89.

Next, we know that the sum of the third column is 306, so we can calculate the value of the first 'x' in the third column as 306 - 89 - 62 = 155.

We also know that the sum of the second row is 315, so we can calculate the value of the first 'x' in the second row as 315 - 90 - 52 - 91 = 82.

Finally, we know that the sum of the third row is 234, so we can calculate the value of the first 'x' in the third row as 234 - 89 - 58 - 62 = 25.

Now, we can fill in the remaining 'x's in the grid. We know that the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 264, so we can calculate the value of the first 'x' in the diagonal as 264 - 91 - 58 - 44 = 71.

The final grid is:

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the 'x' values in the grid such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

First, let's fill in the values for the rows and columns where we have constraints. 

For the second row, we know that the sum of the row should be 234 and we already have a '40' in the row. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 234 - 40 = 194. We need to choose three unique numbers from the range 36 to 92 that add up to 194 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 36, 37, and 121 for the three 'x' values in the second row. 

For the third row, we know that the sum of the row should be 271 and we already have '63', '82', and '59' in the row. So, the remaining number should be 271 - 63 - 82 - 59 = 67. 

For the second column, we know that the sum of the column should be 295 and we already have '47' and '82' in the column. So, the sum of the remaining two numbers should be 295 - 47 - 82 = 166. We need to choose two unique numbers from the remaining numbers that add up to 166 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 38 and 128 for the two 'x' values in the second column. 

For the third column, we know that the sum of the column should be 200 and we already have a '59' in the column. So, the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 200 - 59 = 141. We need to choose three unique numbers from the remaining numbers that add up to 141 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 39, 40, and 62 for the three 'x' values in the third column. 

Finally, for the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid, we know that the sum of the numbers should be 248. We already have a '39' in the diagonal, so the sum of the remaining three numbers should be 248 - 39 = 209. We need to choose three unique numbers from the remaining numbers that add up to 209 and are as low as possible. Let's choose 41, 42, and 126 for the three 'x' values in the diagonal. 

So, the final grid would look like this:

 [['39' '47' '39' '41']
 ['36' '37' '40' '40']
 ['63' '82' '59' '67']
 ['38' '128' '62' '126']]

And the final answer would be:
