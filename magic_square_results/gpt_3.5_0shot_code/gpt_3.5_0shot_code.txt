Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define a function `is_magic_square` that checks if a given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
2. Define a function `find_min_sum_magic_square` that iterates through all permutations of unique integers in the given range to fill in the grid and checks if it forms a magic square with the specified row, column, and diagonal sums.
3. Update the grid with the current permutation of integers and check if it is a magic square.
4. If the current grid is a magic square, calculate the sum of all numbers in the grid and update the minimum sum and corresponding grid configuration if the current sum is lower.
5. Return the grid configuration with the minimum sum as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. Print the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given grid satisfies the conditions of being a magic square (sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are equal to the specified values).
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function generates all possible permutations of unique integers in the range [20, 39] to fill in the 'x' positions in the grid.
3. For each permutation, the function checks if the grid forms a magic square. If it does, it calculates the sum of the numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum found so far.
4. Finally, the function returns the grid with the minimum sum of numbers.
5. The script calls the `find_min_sum_magic_square` function and prints the resulting grid.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given 3x3 grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square as described in the problem.
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds all the unknown positions represented by 'x'.
3. It generates all possible permutations of unique integers in the given range to replace the 'x's in the grid.
4. For each permutation, it fills in the unknown positions in the grid and checks if it forms a magic square.
5. If a magic square is found, it calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum and corresponding square if the current sum is lower.
6. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
7. The solution is then printed out.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square (row sums, column sums, and diagonal sums are all equal to the specified values).
2. The `find_unique_integers` function initializes the grid with 'x's and creates a list of possible integers to replace the 'x's.
3. It then generates all permutations of the possible integers for the unknown positions in the grid and checks if each permutation forms a magic square.
4. If a magic square is found with a lower sum than the current minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding solution.
5. Finally, the function returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script calls the `find_unique_integers` function and prints the solution.

2. The `find_min_sum` function generates all permutations of unique integers in the range [28, 57] to replace the 'x's in the grid. It then checks if each permutation results in a magic square and calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid.
3. The script initializes the grid and calls the `find_min_sum` function to find the minimum sum of all numbers in the grid that satisfies the magic square conditions.
4. Finally, the script prints the minimum sum of all numbers in the grid.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. Define a function `is_magic_square` that checks if a given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
2. Define a function `solve_magic_square` that generates all possible permutations of unique integers for the unknown positions in the grid, fills in the grid with these permutations, and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
3. Iterate through all permutations and update the minimum sum and solution if a valid magic square is found.
4. Return the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at each position.
5. Print the solution.

3. For each permutation, the function constructs a grid with the unknown positions filled and checks if it is a magic square.
4. If a magic square is found, the total sum of the grid is calculated and compared to the current minimum sum.
5. The function returns the positions and values of the unique integers that result in the magic square with the lowest total sum.

Explanation of the steps:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function initializes the grid with unknown positions and possible values for those positions.
3. It then generates all permutations of the possible values for the unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a magic square is found, it calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum if necessary.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given 3x3 grid satisfies the conditions of being a magic square (sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are equal to specified values).
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function generates all permutations of unique integers in the range [50, 84] for the unknown positions in the grid and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
3. The function keeps track of the grid with the minimum sum of all numbers found so far.
4. Finally, the function returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integers replaced in the grid.
5. The solution is then printed to the console.

1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given grid satisfies the conditions of being a magic square (sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are equal to specified values).
2. The `find_minimal_sum` function generates all possible permutations of unique integers in the range [9, 48] to replace the 'x's in the grid. It then checks if each permutation forms a magic square and calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid.
3. The script initializes the grid with 'x's and two known numbers. It then calls the `find_minimal_sum` function to find the solution that satisfies the conditions and has the lowest sum of numbers.
4. Finally, the script prints the solution grid.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
2. The `find_min_sum` function generates all possible permutations of unique integers in the range [26, 65) to replace the 'x's in the grid and checks if each permutation forms a magic square.
3. The function returns the grid with the minimum sum of all numbers that satisfies the magic square conditions.
4. The script initializes the grid with 'x's and '32' at the known position.
5. It then calls the `find_min_sum` function to find the solution.
6. Finally, it formats the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the replaced integer at each 'x' position.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid is a magic square by calculating the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals and comparing them to the specified values.
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function initializes the grid with unknown positions represented as 'x' and creates a list of possible values to replace 'x' with.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a magic square is found, it calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum and corresponding square if the current sum is lower.
5. Finally, the function returns the list of tuples representing the positions and values of unique integers to replace 'x' with to achieve the minimum sum magic square.
6. The script calls the `find_min_sum_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if a given grid is a magic square by calculating the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals and comparing them to the specified values.
2. The `find_min_sum_magic_square` function initializes the grid with unknown values represented as 'x' and creates a list of possible values to replace the 'x's.
3. It then generates all permutations of the possible values for the unknown positions in the grid and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a magic square is found with a lower sum than the current minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding grid.
5. Finally, the function returns a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integers replaced with 'x' in the grid with the lowest sum.
6. The solution is then printed out.

print(best_solution)
```

In this script, we first define the given grid, sums, and the range of unique integers. We then generate all permutations of unique integers from 40 to 89. 

Next, we define a function `is_valid` to check if a grid satisfies the given conditions and another function `total_sum` to calculate the sum of all numbers in the grid.

We iterate through all permutations of unique integers and for each permutation, we create a new grid by replacing the 'x's in the given grid with the unique integers. We then check if the new grid satisfies the conditions and calculate the total sum of the grid. If the total sum is lower than the best sum found so far, we update the best sum and the best solution.

Finally, we print the best solution found, which is a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

Explanation of the steps:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies all the constraints of a magic square.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid, finds the positions of unknown values ('x'), generates all possible values for the unknown positions, and then iterates through all permutations of these values to find a solution that satisfies the magic square constraints.
3. The script then prints the solution, which is a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknown values ('x') and possible unique integers to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions, updates the grid, checks if it is a magic square, and keeps track of the solution with the lowest total sum.
4. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.

Explanation of the steps:
1. Define a function `check_sums` that checks if the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals in the grid satisfy the given constraints.
2. Define a function `solve_magic_square` that initializes the grid with given values and 'x's, finds the indices of 'x's, and generates possible values for 'x's.
3. Iterate through all permutations of possible values for 'x's, replace 'x's in the grid with these values, and check if the sums are valid.
4. Keep track of the solution with the minimum total sum of the grid that satisfies all constraints.
5. Return the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. Print the solution obtained by calling `solve_magic_square`.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknowns ('x') and possible values that can be used to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions, fills the grid with these values, and checks if it forms a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found with the sum of all numbers lower than the current minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum and saves the solution.
5. Finally, the function returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies all the constraints of a magic square.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknown values ('x').
3. It generates all possible permutations of unique integers in the given range to replace the unknown values in the grid.
4. For each permutation, it checks if the grid satisfies the magic square constraints. If it does, it calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum and solution if a new minimum is found.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

1. Define a function `check_sums` to check if the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals in the grid satisfy the given constraints.
2. Define a function `solve_magic_square` to find the solution to the magic square problem.
3. Initialize the grid with the given values and unknown positions.
4. Generate all possible permutations of unique integers in the given range for the unknown positions in the grid.
5. For each permutation, fill in the unknown positions in the grid and check if the sums satisfy the constraints.
6. If the sums are valid, calculate the total sum of the grid and update the minimum sum and solution if a new minimum is found.
7. Return the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
8. Print the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknown values ('x') and possible unique integers to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for the unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found, it calculates the sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum and solution if the current sum is lower.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies all the constraints of a magic square.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknowns ('x') and possible values that can be used to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found with the sum of all numbers lower than the current minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding solution.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then prints the solution to the magic square problem.

Explanation of the steps:
1. Define a function `is_magic_square` to check if the given grid satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
2. Define a function `solve_magic_square` to find the solution to the magic square problem.
3. Initialize the grid with the given values and unknown positions.
4. Generate all possible values for the unknown positions.
5. Iterate through all permutations of possible values for the unknown positions.
6. Check if the grid with the current values satisfies the conditions of a magic square.
7. If it does, calculate the total sum of the grid and update the minimum sum and solution if the current sum is lower.
8. Finally, return the solution with the minimum sum.
9. Print the solution obtained from `solve_magic_square`.

2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and identifies the positions of unknowns ('x').
3. It generates all permutations of unique integers in the given range for the unknown positions and checks if the sums are valid using the `check_sums` function.
4. It keeps track of the solution with the minimum total sum of the grid.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and identifies the positions of unknowns ('x') and possible values that can be used to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all possible permutations of values for the unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found with a lower sum than the current minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding solution.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then prints the solution to the magic square problem.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknowns ('x') and possible values that can be used to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions, fills the grid with these values, and checks if it forms a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found with a lower total sum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding solution.
5. Finally, the function returns the solution in the form of a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknown values ('x') and possible unique integers to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions, updates the grid, checks if it is a magic square, and keeps track of the solution with the minimum sum.
4. Finally, it returns the solution with the minimum sum as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
5. The script then prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the given grid satisfies all the conditions of a magic square.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and finds the positions of unknown values ('x') and possible unique integers to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all permutations of possible values for unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found, it calculates the total sum of all numbers in the grid and updates the minimum sum and solution if the current sum is lower.
5. Finally, it returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.

Explanation of the steps taken:
1. The `is_magic_square` function checks if the current grid satisfies all the constraints of the magic square problem.
2. The `solve_magic_square` function initializes the grid with the given values and identifies the positions of unknown values ('x') and possible unique integers to replace them.
3. It then iterates through all possible permutations of unique integers for the unknown positions and checks if the resulting grid is a magic square.
4. If a valid magic square is found with a lower total sum than the current minimum, it updates the minimum sum and the corresponding solution.
5. Finally, the function returns the solution as a list of tuples containing the row index, column index, and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.
6. The script then calls the `solve_magic_square` function and prints the solution.
