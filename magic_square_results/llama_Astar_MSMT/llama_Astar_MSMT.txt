The problem is a variant of the magic square problem, where we need to fill a 3x3 grid with unique integers from a given range such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. 

We will use A* search algorithm to solve this problem. A* is a pathfinding algorithm frequently used for finding the shortest path between two points. We will use the sum of the absolute differences between the current state and the goal state as the heuristic function.

This code first initializes the problem variables, including the grid, sums of rows and columns, and the diagonal sum. It then defines the A* search algorithm, which includes generating all possible actions from the current state, checking if the new state satisfies the given constraints, and updating the priority queue with the new state if it does. The heuristic function estimates the cost to reach the goal state, in this case, the difference between the current sum of all the numbers in the grid and the goal sum of all the numbers in the grid. The a_star function is generic, only encoding the A* algorithm, not any values or attributes given in the problem.

In this code, we first initialize the problem variables and the initial state of the magic square. Then, we implement the A* search algorithm in the a_star function. In this function, we generate all possible actions from the current state (replacing each 'x' with a unique integer from the given range) and check if the new state is valid (meets the constraints on the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonal). If the new state is valid, we calculate the new total sum of the numbers in the grid and the cost of reaching this state. If this cost is lower than the cost of reaching the current state, we add the new state to the queue of un-visited states. The heuristic function calculates the difference between the current total sum of the numbers in the grid and the goal total sum, which is used to estimate the remaining cost to reach the goal state. The check_constraints function checks if the new state meets the constraints on the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonal.

The solution provided is a list of tuples in Python syntax, where each tuple contains three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position. The numbers are generated by the A* search algorithm, which is a generic algorithm that can be applied to any problem by encoding the problem states as a graph, initializing visited_costs and the priority queue, and implementing the A* algorithm in the a_star function. The rationale behind each line of code is explained using comments.

The goal is to find unique integers (ie each number can be in the final grid only once) in the given range to replace with ‘x’s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' 'x' 'x' '39']\n ['28' 'x' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' '11' '33' 'x']\n ['18' '20' '38' '35']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['', '', '', '39'], ['28', '', '', ''], ['', '11', '33', ''], ['18', '20', '38', '35']]", 4, 9, 40], 'is_correct': ["[['', '', '', '39'], ['28', '', '', ''], ['', '11', '33', ''], ['18', '20', '38', '35']]", 9, 40, [1, 3], [1, 3], [77, 110], [114, 84], 98], 'Astar': ["[['', '', '', '39'], ['28', '', '', ''], ['', '11', '33', ''], ['18', '20', '38', '35']]", '9', '40', '[None, 77, 110, None]', '[None, 114, 84, None]', '98'], 'opt': [[[0, 0, 10], [0, 1, 12], [0, 2, 9], [1, 1, 34], [1, 2, 30], [1, 3, 22], [2, 0, 13], [2, 3, 27]], 379, 0.18021273612976074]}
