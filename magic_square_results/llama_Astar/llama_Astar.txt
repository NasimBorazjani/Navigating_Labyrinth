{'difficulty': 9, 'statement': "In the magic square problem, a 4x4 grid is filled with unique integers ranging from 28 to 64. Some numbers are already given, while others are unknown and represented as 'x'. The sums of columns must be None, 157, 200, None for columns 1 to 2 respectively, and the sums of rows must be None, 193, 158, None for rows 1 to 2 respectively, where None means that we do not have any constraints on the sum of the numbers in the row or column at that index.  Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 183.

Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 248. The goal is to find unique integers (ie each number can be in the final grid only once) in the given range to replace with ‘x’s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['39' '47' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' 'x' '40']\n ['63' '82' '59' 'x']\n ['x' '78' 'x' 'x']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['39', '47', '', ''], ['', '', '', '40'], ['63', '82', '59', ''], ['', '78', '', '']]", 4, 36, 92], 'is_correct': ["[['39', '47', '', ''], ['', '', '', '40'], ['63', '82', '59', ''], ['', '78', '', '']]", 36, 92, [1, 3], [1, 3], [295, 200], [234, 271], 248], 'Astar': ["[['39', '47', '', ''], ['', '', '', '40'], ['63', '82', '59', ''], ['', '78', '', '']]", '36', '92', '[None, 295, 200, None]', '[None, 234, 271, None]', '248'], 'opt': [[[0, 2, 36], [0, 3, 42], [1, 0, 38], [1, 1, 88], [1, 2, 68], [2, 3, 67], [3, 0, 56], [3, 2, 37], [3, 3, 41]], 881, 8.308101177215576]}
