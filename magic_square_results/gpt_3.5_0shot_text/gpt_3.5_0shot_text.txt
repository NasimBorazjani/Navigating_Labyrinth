The goal is to find unique integers (ie each number can be in the final grid only once) in the given range to replace with ‘x’s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['x' '69' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' '62' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' '82' '40' 'x']\n ['x' '87' '78' '80']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['', '69', '', ''], ['', '62', '', ''], ['', '82', '40', ''], ['', '87', '78', '80']]", 4, 36, 92], 'is_correct': ["[['', '69', '', ''], ['', '62', '', ''], ['', '82', '40', ''], ['', '87', '78', '80']]", 36, 92, [1, 3], [1, 3], [300, 191], [214, 240], 249], 'Astar': ["[['', '69', '', ''], ['', '62', '', ''], ['', '82', '40', ''], ['', '87', '78', '80']]", '36', '92', '[None, 300, 191, None]', '[None, 214, 240, None]', '249'], 'opt': [[[0, 0, 38], [0, 2, 36], [0, 3, 39], [1, 0, 41], [1, 2, 37], [1, 3, 74], [2, 0, 42], [2, 3, 76], [3, 0, 91]], 972, 1449.0436754226685]}
