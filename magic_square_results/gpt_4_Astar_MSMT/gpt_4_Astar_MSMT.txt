{'difficulty': 6, 'statement': "In the magic square problem, a 3x3 grid is filled with unique integers ranging from 29 to 48. Some numbers are already given, while others are unknown and represented as 'x'. Sum of column 1 (counting from 0) must be 107, and sum of row 1 must be 103. Also, the sum of the numbers in the diagonal from the top right to the bottom left corner of the grid should equal 124. The goal is to find unique integers (ie each number can be in the final grid only once) in the given range to replace with ‘x’s in the grid below such that the sum of the specified rows, columns, and diagonal equals the given amounts and the sum of all of the numbers in the grid is as low as possible. The solution should be provided as a list of tuples in Python syntax. Each tuple should contain three numbers for each 'x' position: the row index, the column index (both starting from 0), and the value of the unique integer replaced with 'x' at that position.\n\nGrid:\n [['35' 'x' '46']\n ['x' 'x' 'x']\n ['x' 'x' 'x']]", 'is_feasible': ["[['35', '', '46'], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]", 3, 29, 48], 'is_correct': ["[['35', '', '46'], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]", 29, 48, [1, 2], [1, 2], [107], [103], 124], 'Astar': ["[['35', '', '46'], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]", '29', '48', '[None, 107, None]', '[None, 103, None]', '124'], 'opt': [[[0, 1, 31], [1, 0, 29], [1, 1, 44], [1, 2, 30], [2, 0, 34], [2, 1, 32], [2, 2, 33]], 314, 0.3927474021911621]}
Code passed constraints!! Complete code extractred, code is excutable and the type of the solution returned is correct!!
